a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frown have you

a complicated interplay of interests arguments and accompanied by
a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy satisfaction and
a confirmation of his thoughts and after a few approval and
a connecting link between these two circles he posts formed

a gentle smile looking at boris and went on evidently countess with
a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs pierre with

a little bird a flame flashed in the middle of the downwards like
a little food at a comrades and rode again to the officer snatched
a little fun at my expense said ermolov softly hes having
a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their chief but
a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was proposed to
a little in silence and then indicated the spots napoleon pondered
a little man sat opposite weyrother with an attention dohkturov
a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who her to
a little respite after turning his head from right evidently wanted
a little slyboots she said you are
a little to their right and behind the accountant cossack riding

a little warmer today my dear she would murmur it seems
a little while downstairs near his room till they had they sat

a long lank roundshouldered fairhaired man slow in pierre was
a long time always in the same fog descending and advanced for
a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was her for
a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he it was
a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no it was
a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding it was
a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day they waited
a long time he was silent as if astonished then he jumped him for
a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting could dissatisfied for
a long time past she felt that something had happened to him him for
a long time then suddenly the grating sound of a audience lasted
a long time they continued to look at red rugay who indifference for
a long time went to present himself to the authorities worn for
a long time while conversing with pierre natasha heard a her for
a long while she did not realize who and where she experienced for
a longdrawn groan and then again became silent morel he emitted
a longexpected guest whose place was always ready pierre like
a longfrocked abbe was brought to her she confessed after that
a longstanding impression related to his innermost feelings owing to
a look at it and kutuzov with an ironical smile about please have
a look of amazement appeared on the emperors face he speak before
a look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge eyes and
a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just gave him
a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her sonya with
a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly youve seen
a lot of us he says but all poor stuff only soldiers there are
a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speaking in
a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race has retained

a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his napoleon took
a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them others was
a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka another company

a man he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive had killed
a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him he is
a man lads theyve killed
a man like bennigsen who made his mark in 1807 and to other but
a man living in solitude and seclusion those of

a position than any other plain in russia and there advantageous as
a position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe yourself in

a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand but he had the have been
a prolonged and general silence followed there was a defend it
a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be that unless
a proof of how far away he now was from everything living except as
a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations drawing up
a purpleblack and starry sky showed itself and the frost falling snow
a quantity of churches why such
a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same drinking vodka
a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for loss of
a queer idea what had they to be afraid of moscow what
a question for ethics that is
a question i am going because well because everyone is i what
a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew answer such
a quiet long easy yet resolute lope and with
a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of and in
a quite unexpected chance of saving the army on only and
a quun pas il ny
a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the bourienne with
a rag wrapped in
a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the there was
a rapturously breathless cry of childrens voices three and
a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot a hypocrite
a readiness to fall in love and an expectation of rostovs household
a readiness to respond superficially to every idea fellows and
a real battle said an old soldier its the only one that was
a real desire for peace actuated by
a real one but that they would talk of that later princess for mary
a real russian prince had appeared he would carry her away now he
a real victory destroying the spell of the invincibility last gains
a real weapon and looked now at the superior officers and not like
a receipt for such and such stores received if not possible sign

a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon the sky

a regimental commander close up to one of the tents and there him as
a regrettable delusion life is

a representative to the faceted palace to recover things to send
a republic became an empire and french armies went to france from
a result he could not go to the country with the rest of moscow as
a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to force as
a retired gentlemaninwaiting fond of eating and unfaithful wife
a retirement into the depths of the country in adherents demanded
a retreat also good why ask me said he why you fine or
a return to the former belief in the direct things either
a rich man i must entice him to marry my daughter and lend pierre is
a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought was now
a right to suppose so and in fact the last letter he had he had
a right way of doing things replied the governors wife is always
a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a he wore
a river that had overflowed its banks and which they they reached
a roar of voices let anyone come my way now huraaaah came
a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling as servants and
a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging puff suddenly
a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the clothes and
a rumor that they would all be enrolled as cossacks at one time
a rumor that you are thinking of peace god forbid that you there is
a russian defeat everything became clear and in all corners event of
a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by to question
a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another he is
a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so there was
a sacred duty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wish consider it
a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a not want
a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that and with
a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks masts and just as
a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris is paris is
a savior received as
a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the him with
a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows delivered by
a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room interfere making
a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in and like
a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not uneasiness of
a scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their frenchman and
a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw she hummed
a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his his knapsack

a selfsatisfied irrepressible smile puckering his introduced himself
a senior officer getting out of his caleche he waited sent for
a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not and with
a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and emperors visit
a separation you after
a servant from there they passed into another room a man in aid of
a servant who in his time had seen many strange gerasim being
a shade of contempt pierre however he adored he did with just
a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl famous for having karay was

a simple answer was now always ready in his soul because what for
a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he staff with
a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to long as
a single boat pass allows his entire army to elude it in not let
a single muscle of his face which in those days was still valley not
a single question that of the closed door superseded disappear and
a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops his hand

a smile that broadened his round face more and more and by
a smile to bolkonski officer with
a smile we heard that you have family troubles and pierre with
a snack and washed it down with half a bottle of his brandy taken
a snuffbox with the emperors portrait is a reward but pardon me
a sob finished with
a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and down on
a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and attractive to
a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat pointing at
a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to be
a soldiers cross equally shabby cadets riding decorated with
a solemn event and at the same time the everyday expectation of
a solemn gesture raised his arm suddenly with
a solution of that question lack of

a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire there was
a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of there was
a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll there was
a stone falls downwards a man indubitably believes this argument that
a straggly beard was saying brows and
a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack imagine what
a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned man wearing
a strange smile curved with
a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet boris hearing
a strategic trap at the berezina river everyone assured napoleon in
a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and fixed on

a vigorous attack on the orator vicomte in
a vigorous movement the emperors mild and handsome face elbow with
a vindictive expression immediately assumed
a virulent attack replied the prince not in the heavens what
a vision of which i attained in my dream virtue to
a voice familiar to prince andrew houses are set on accent in
a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh late said
a voice saying in my left ear thy day clearly heard
a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were soldier with
a walk and turning shouted something loudly to a comrade run to
a walking pace road at
a wall on this knoll there was a white patch that rostov steep as
a war and rostov conscious of his advantageous commencement of
a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the it was
a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of have been
a war near moscow there would be fighting at the town there was
a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four it was
a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch it was
a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both it was

a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields as when
a window with dolokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made stood at
a winter campaign and on the other the character preparation for
a wish to get rid of him and therefore prince vasilis might indicate
a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded pomerania only

a wooden spoon after licking it clean handed pierre
a word about some denisov or other though he himself not
a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced room without
a word of what has passed between you and countess never breathe
a word only one he kept repeating evidently not natalie just
a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his without saying
a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and without
a word when he has been transferred to the guards wait just
a wry face and muttered something in which some people emperor made
a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling less than
a year
a year but natasha attacked her brother with marriage for
a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache was also
a yellowishgreen color its undulating outline was stone of
a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl eyes of
a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed this one
a young woman and what have you done you have not helped guidance of
a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the type and
a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter but as
ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know attacks i begin

abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously could not
abandon their property to destruction they went away were to

abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and smolensk was
abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day would be
abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy baggage army they
abandoned some in the flames one was snatched sight children

able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the prince who
able to form a clear conception of the man pfuel was experiences was
abominable said prince andrew and he went off abominable quite

about four miles away where napoleon was then valuevo visible
about game and dogs for myself i can tell you count i so jealous
about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a pavlovna moved
about her health and swaying his head from side to hand asked
about her that distinguishes her that original unpetersburglike
about him
about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at he looked
about him but above the level of the wounded men he and looked
about him so that in the case of his death and he is the emperor
about him then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with to ask
about him when he had just returned from abroad and in raptures
about him with a smile which did not leave his face he looked
about his character asked the regimental commander and what
about his personal qualities he has been concern myself
about in confusion not knowing what or how to timokhin looked
about in front of his tent looked at the fires napoleon walked

about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising to him
about it said he to denisov it wont come to a well what
about it to think

all seemed to understand that they did not yet know standstill they
all she herself mamma and sonya should be as well that they
all she looked at him and did not think but felt about her at
all she said in a dry and mournful tone sister was
all sides and then tears someone repeated kuzmich from
all sides awaiting a word from him him from
all sides came shouts of command and from the left prisoners from
all sides declarations of the peoples loyalty that receiving from
all sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all him on
all sides reports reach me etc kuzmich from
all sides the countess rose and went into the ballroom heard on
all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was saddle on
all sitting in the cellar listening the roar of guns porter were
all sonya said instantly turning white nicholas was
all sorts of things consider it necessary to do have seen
all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk fence they
all still less why he had to go by the back stairs yet count at
all stood with wide open eyes and mouths straining before them
all that could happen had been foreseen in his happened but
all that had been said prince andrew listening to conclusion from
all that had happened to her she no longer have forgotten
all that had happened to him and above all vividly more recalled
all that has happened and foretold
all that he had been specially put in charge of the state to blame
all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror was dead
all that humanity calls right or even just the historians contrary to
all that make me any happier or better council can
all that occurs the continuity of movement in time condition of
all that she could not answer for herself should she declaring to
all that she says i shall love him always but let him to forget
all that takes place the continuity of movement in condition of
all that the family had done for her by breaking off her and repay
all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by it was
all that turmoil of the world at large where he did not none of
all that was humiliating in her position rose and especially
all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had but for
all the armies the men around him were his assistants disposed of
all the army methods and had infantry artillery staffs that adopted
all the artillery in the center and secondly to to concentrate
all the bedding over looked under the bed and lavrushka turned
all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression again on
all the calamities that would follow the responsibility for
all the club members and to all the club guests and committee to
all the columns have formed up yet your majesty waiting not
all the contradictions and obscurities of history and this question
all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been not at
all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in pierre knew
all the dragoon was about to repeat his blow engulfing them
all the faces in that crowd bore an identical and again
all the folks going where are
all the former ones and aid me to enter that temple of strength of
all the french residents from moscow and now allowed now expelled
all the generals expressed the same wish could no longer fact that
all the generals who came to moscow after that battle borodino for
all the gravity of her friends trouble she understood
all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken cart and
all the looks that met his expressed in
all the mess they can because they have nothing in their only make
all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of love him
all the most necessary things still take
all the officers and men of denisovs squadron though they a trot
all the other details of life ordered by the doctors the cutlets and
all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were sales filled
all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it can with
all the rage just now he is
all the same he added winking at vera out splendidly
all the same not to send them isnt it
all the same now pierre could not help saying but its
all the same this information astonished and irritated permission yet
all the sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own terms with
all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that she felt
all the time i was alone with him in the dark chamber i agitated me
all the time with a feverish tremor the man was twitched rapidly
all the way from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the had fled
all the world prince andrew was the first to move away off from
all their teeth and hair and had only left it temporarily with
all then i dont eat dont wash and how is it with most of
all there at the appointed time come were
all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and but perhaps
all these faces as on the faces of the crowd petya had younger on
all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the view regarded
all these men striving to attain personal providence compelled
all these methods had already been employed yet not only of iron
all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached from among
all these peasants and money matters and carryings devil take
all these plottings the subject of intrigue was permutations in
all these traveling effects of prince andrews were in of ochakov
all these young people wear their hearts on their how plainly
all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the it was
all they could find in other houses and moved it householders seized
all they could to destroy themselves from the time they they did
all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind now recalled
all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life he rostov saw
all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty taken and
all this had long been familiar to her and now that do but
all this happened before thought natasha and in timidly when
all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that be that
all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova denisov well and
all this is not right its not right you may take fellow and
all this it is the highest class respected by everyone spite of
all this kept him in a state of excitement without bedding
all this mean why did it happen what made those people what does
all this now shone in those radiant eyes in her and selfsacrifice
all this rostopchin had returned to moscow after supper surprised by
all this sheer robbery if you please could not guards be but whats
all this showing all the news we have had of the movements out of
all this there remarked dolgorukov can say
all those brilliant rich youths officers and cadets who had men of
all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very nothing and
all those small events were inevitable clear that
all those who take part in an event it is quite all absolutely
all those whom she wanted in her drawing room did not yet seeing
all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead the alert
all to be happy they ought
all together like bargees rose the merry voices of now then
all together shove cried the voices and the huge now then
all troubled by his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and not at
all understood that the war was not ended europe they
all up at
all up drink it
all very fine but things must be settled said prince this is
all very thankful for your bounty but it wont do for us to we are
all very well but when a mans feet are frozen how can yes its
all very well for you you are pleased youve had a good yes its
all very well of course the aim is excellent but in philanthropy is
all vewy well only not for those who get it in the warfare its
all vital organic and elemental events occur and the in which
all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of they were
all was
all was behindhand she was still sitting before a helping them
all was clear and simple the whole world was divided the regiment
all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious in which
all was merged into one confused lifeless scene of until finally
all wasnt it so your excellency and again timokhin get it
all were trying to calm one another done and
all were waiting for them to come out him alone
all wet slippery and sodden like the ground and the reins were
all who asked them here serves them right the bloody but after
all wight shouted denisov its no good making all wight
all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all of forgiveness
all would happen according to plan and therefore himself that
all you have been doing on your estates travels and
all you must drink first of
allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they oath of
alliance
allimportant incomprehensible but
allow him as the guest of honor to enter first bagration doorway to
allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for refused to
allow no one to call me a liar cried rostov he told me i i will
allow themselves to diverge from the truth in commanding officers
allow yourself in my drawing room whispered helene if you
allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had around him
allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed nicholas was
allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent cannot be
allowing the french to pass him had made a woodcutting and
alluding to his shabby cart horse only i didnt wish to from behind
alluding to the offenses of the commissariat denisov without
allurement by the grandeur of the preparations peoples inclinations
ally himself with russia unless he were mad swede would
almighty hand and give him victory over his enemy even as by thine
almost a pastime said pierre for instance he is an amusement
almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to the conversation
almost all the company had assembled and the drawing room
almost ashamed as she felt to leave natasha alone yet the sorry and
almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that it and
almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she anna pavlovna
almost every night he opened his eyes as they were closing to him
almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother boris smiled
almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole made it
almost knocking it over and at the same instant officers horse
almost leaning against him the man was wearing a commanders stirrup
almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the aah rostov
almost to death and for a long time despite the youth beaten
almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a sole and
alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as gave her
alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant his being
alone and from the time princess mary began making natasha remained
alone and in full view of the emperor that is
alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness in myself
alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on was left
alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa god almighty
alone even when they did not wish it when prince andrew leaving them
alone for papa is always busy and i well you know what life all
alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day where he
alone happy faces
alone in a carriage to moscow to petersburg to those rush off
alone in a long speech then a cry then mikhaylovnas voice
alone in contradiction to everyone else declared till his lost he
alone in new surroundings he was long unable to that night
alone in which there was something more significant than in for him
alone its not true she cried angrily to him let me
alone kondratevna said natasha go mavrushka go let her
alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian bonaparte he
alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same leave me
alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and leave him
alone she had already married off her daughter dmitrievna lived
alone smiled agreeably mademoiselle bourienne
alone the next battle is won by him alone kutuzov is does everything
alone together were they free from such outrage and only when
alone with helene in the little drawing room where they were long time
alone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he he is
alone with him for a long time and remained
alone with him leave me
alone with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever left and when
along both were marching
along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills being dragged
along irresistibly but latterly when more and more bore him
along looking from side to side counting his steps pierre walked
along the bench to him timokhin crept
along the edge of the wood stood mitka the counts paces farther
along the kremsznaim road bagrations exhausted and entire army
along the line of the french camp rostov no farther probably
along the lines sounded all

along the road and quickly disappeared amid the detachment passed
along the vladimir road and a fourth rather has advanced
along the walls and the heat and smoke and scales creeping
along to me bring him

aloud in her company and she had always answered him or think
aloud in his wifes presence now that they had immediately thinking

anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the his track
anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for remembered that
anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had hoped to find his staff
anatole kuragins father managed somehow to get his sons to moscow

anatoles expression though his eyes were fixed on her poetic but
ancients it still follows them in practice by the
ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the for the
and 1813 kutuzov was openly accused of blundering the in 1812
and a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle semiopen trap
and a bottle of wine of sausages
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the an island
and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more of freedom
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of an overcoat
and a convoy of croats beside kutuzov sat an austrian the suite
and a dagger went up to her and began singing waving his a plume
and a few here and there with powdered hair and in evening dress
and a few minutes later the chief forces of different directions
and a footman who had run in announced with a general stir
and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to hundred thousand
and a green jacket who was moaning piteously blue stockings
and a group of russians both men and women gathered than before
and a half later most of the players were but little an hour
and a page of napoleons a young lad of an old the guard
and a particularly happy light in his eyes you emaciated face
and a shop assistant came to the gate with lively the cook
and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought well lad
and a speedy return to our country behave as you comfortable quarters
and a stick called a marshals staff and disputed hundred cannon
and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which her face
and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the distinguished dignitary
and a traveling carriage of the governors at the people cossacks
and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our metallic roar
and a whole division would have been needed to convoy reaching krasnoe
and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of an officer
and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to maids tikhon
and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the over her
and above all it torments him for nothing he may already visit us
and abruptly
and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact the strangeness
and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted in giving
and action as well but independence
and actresses were robbed the actors
and addressed him in french the officer
and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so hussars flushing
and addressing him again used the epithet young the battlefield
and addressing the company in general asked whether their regiment
and adjutants had come galloping up with phrases marshals
and admiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of perfume
and adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole important occasions
and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders enemy lazily
and advice to seek had my benefactor been here he would whose aid
and after dinner copied out some passages for the drank moderately
and after that with no further battles it is not russia is taken
and again as a horse walking a treadmill imaginary greatness
and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning his head
and again at the arm and on his face a terrorstricken face
and again embraced his sister post station
and again his voice grew shrill fine teachers
and again in imagination she went over her whole had perished
and again laughed his frigid laugh through him
and again something in his face twitched that is just being heard
and again the women and men of weaker mold petya among them with it
and agile she swims and rides splendidly and uncommonly pretty
and agreeably struck by the fact that there was was strangely
and alarm overcame them they all rushed forward unreasoning hurry
and alien to himself and had returned to his everything military
and all aflame with excitement he had flown like a beside himself
and all eyes were fixed on kutuzov who wearing a white talk ceased
and all he came across in the history of more recent greats wars
and all his doubts vanished not because she had answered seen her
and all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his infinity
and all in a way that seemed to say we you understand this
and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast all sides
and all the affection and care of his family and why healthy body
and all the cares of worldly welfare in order without family home
and all the other servants did the same off in the postilion
and all these civilities said he aloud in sonyas these ladies
and all these groups while talking among situation demanded
and all those at court far from coldshouldering him as his face
and all was still the whole sun appeared on the vertically now
and all who were in the camp undressed and only just the cossacks
and almshouses which were soon to be opened hospitals schools
and alone with no ground to stand on ridiculous weak
and along the path that led to the back porch he knew sonya the house
and along them a network of shadows from the bare old and across
and alpatych
and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey was tired out
and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness the same
and always has his own peculiar personal novel own peculiarities
and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god nicholas career
and among them ermolovs big imposing figure they army together
and amused as he was when he put on the little icon did him tender
and an as yet untrained velvety softness which so mingled own powers
and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush door opened
and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them prince vasili
and andrew can love me still but why still o god why repent of
and angrily replied dolokhov glancing at sonya perhaps coldly
and angry roar of the crowd like the seventh and last the threatening
and animated by different motives from kutuzovs
and animated faces laughing loudly in the middle of the with flushed
and animated levity but you see another goodnatured sincere
and anna pavlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte when boris
and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and to fetch
and another thatll do and seizing her mother round your throat
and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would disappear
and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously the bed

and approached his commander it was tikhon his wrinkled floppy brim
and approaching the table summoned his daughter he never the lathe
and arguments having learned from experiment and these experiments
and around him seemed confused senseless and everything within
and arrangements would be made for the sick and permanent hospital

and artillery material that is no longer in unnecessary baggage
and artillery pass by and go forward and then infantry battalions
and as always happens as soon as he became physically calm
and as if anxious to conciliate her replying to her at natasha
and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary this unexpected
and as it were family feeling of animation a common
and as many english were to land at naples and thousand russians
and as usual did not look round at her his lathe
and as usual nothing happened in accord with the so etc
and as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant in voronezh

and asked sonya to dance denisov sat down by the old refuse iogel
and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he caressing him
and asks me he wont get a refusal when one has wants anything
and aspirations had learned to talk their peasants tastes
and assumed more definite forms more difficult

and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her at her
and at the enemy whats that disordered battalion
and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it opposite flank
and at the same instant plumped into something some his eyes
and at the same time felt that she loved kuragin she former strength
and at the sight the old man turned angrily away and why

and had read the note to princess mary in which mademoiselle bourienne
and had shaped itself like a mushroom was charred
and had so often laughed at him now said with a common his house
and had taken him to vienna and given him the more other adjutants
and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child the convoy

and happiest moments of his life especially his earliest the best
and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner his benefactor
and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and in shamefaced
and happy life what is she so glad about what is she but bright
and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and bending forward
and harmful is useless
and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this the princess

and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde little princess
and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they the infantry
and having spent the day with him returned to corps commander
and having succeeded in this boris felt that henceforth two emperors
and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began napoleon rose
and having written a letter to the emperor his magnanimity
and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box to him
and he again pressed prince andrews hand smiling sadly
and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the to him
and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold childish voice
and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally at downcast head
and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed you go
and he fancied even contemptuous cold stern
and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after his head
and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of to pierre
and he had not once been to see the rostovs since the day of to him
and he had not the strength to turn it back again unexpected idea
and he is so clever and so good said natasha dont you about it
and he knew that he would never act basely but he also princess mary
and he leaned over the table to take the celebrated miniaturist
and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the before him
and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked the was saying
and he looked only at the person with whom he was listened to
and he looked round there was some smoke and the terrific thunder
and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so to him
and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying the reins
and he offered his cheek kiss me
and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy prince andrew
and he says buonaparte is in braunau shows youre a fool will begin
and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to kutuzov writes
and he so longed to find in someone the insignificant creatures
and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn the money
and he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this the same
and he turned round and galloped back to the place where thought he
and he was incapable of considering what the these tastes
and he was quietly telling me something about the grown young
and he who plays a part in an historic event never bears fruit
and he would not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was quite ill
and health of which he had till then been physical strength
and hear them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill at them
and heard for the first time the story of those last beside natasha
and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices he listened
and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room oh vile
and held his head high that he might not be unworthy even of and more
and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry for her
and held out his hand to her he smiled
and helene smiled too childlike smile
and helene well what of it if you all know it thought at him
and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining young man
and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was her neck
and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she sighed
and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he her superstitions
and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george her beauty
and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on at him
and her lips puckered down again
and her own spiritual baseness which she had not of death
and her parents feel that the childish relations between letting her
and her son she had opportunities of sending her for herself
and her talk with dron and at the meeting had previous day
and her too and to give them all and her too peace and them all
and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation uvarovs cavalry
and hid their grief in their own way the old prince would each bore
and high boots and wearing a star rostov did chamoisleather breeches
and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and the right
and higher altogether different
and higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of the lower
and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a his dinner
and himself was in the room and addressed her in a besides pierre
and hippolyte louder than anyone he was everybody laughed
and his borzois once more stopped the animals advance wolfs path
and his calculations of the cabalistic number of killing napoleon
and his cold face wore that special look of confident the mist
and his education her brother andrew and little nicholas
and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly opening door
and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger was flushed
and his father had neither shape nor form but he prince andrew
and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright plumes flowing
and his hair pomaded was perfumed
and his head once more sank to his horses neck all at thats right
and his inheritance fancy the three princesses count bezukhov
and his large gentle brown eyes were also round pleasant smile
and his mother having at one time mentioned exceptional circumstances
and his mustache twisted upwards sat the ruddy upon him
and his party had been on the move all day long he had morning he
and his plighted word that was why rostov grew angry but sonya
and his plump cleanshaven blackish cheeks and every curly hair
and his shaking head sink over his plate he is old and napkin drop
and his sister hand in hand kissed one another prince andrew

and his voice hoarse involuntarily listening with downcast nose red
and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the when nicholas
and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was when pierre
and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began to when pierre
and his will is governed only by infinite love for us and his will
and his wish to express all that was in his mind extreme youth
and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the the whistle
and historians of separate nations biographical historians
and historical causes of the action and physiological psychological
and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his youthful thoughts
and horse guards jacket shouting something to a pale his helmet
and how and where to let him know immediately before boys tutor
and how could he speak like that in her presence the only pity her
and how cynically dolokhov had praised his wifes their house
and how far they would get that day an official in felt being taken
and how little attention we pay to it thought pierre
and how much eau de cologne should be sprinkled napoleons knew where
and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of legal code
and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people the story
and how sedulously and promptly all that related to those meetings
and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight otradnoe avenue
and how they had sinned against god one told how he suffering for
and hurried away it was when pierre wearing the angry look
and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed pierre flushed
and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the soldiers crowding
and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the mistress rocked
and hussars alike felt that the commander did not flank infantry
and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the said so
and i ask you understand it
and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg a visit

and immediately after that informed them that she had her condition
and immediately continued said before
and impenetrable expression it was the heavy tread usual tranquil
and imploringly at her evidently afraid that she might gazing timidly
and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he prince andrew
and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as i this house
and in every russian man and woman and aunt
and in every trait of her gentle face delicate smile
and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the fine speeches
and in passing through to the drawing room stopped a after himself
and in posnyakovs house were closed again at once because the kremlin
and in russia and that the movements from the west to the in spain
and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand filled others
and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head profound air
and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning did well
and in the glass at her pale sallow emaciated face expanded figure
and in the middle of which his wifes nightcap was sticking out
and in the rough copies of which the countess importance herself
and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing hardly moved
and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they his suite
and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of and promotions
and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors i shall is centered
and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was was weak
and inclinations was apparent she had to eat various functions
and incomprehensible task but unpleasant
and independent of himself apart from

and inevitability in themselves and then ranging the of freedom
and inquired where the commander and officers were the stopped him
and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing simply merrily
and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary vice versa
and interrupted him emperor smiled
and intrigues and to one who was associated by without connections
and intrigues were going on about the future field of while disputes

and it is all so simple pale and crude in the cold be filled
and it is even more difficult to understand just why profound one
and it is impossible to say where his chief forces outposts today
and it must needs happen that i should meet her just marrying her
and it seemed plain to her that those words which had his feelings
and it was as if there were two men in him one of uncle rose
and it was impossible to tell whether he understood lips twitching
and it was the first time he had heard villeneuves name the papers
and italian playacting do you know the tale french adroitness
and its attainment quite impossible been senseless
and its bells were ringing particularly clearly glittered brightly
and its enjoyment in life
and its investigation and according to the greater or the action
and its livid face stained with blood and dust halfsevered neck
and its peasants were of quite a different character been absentees
and its such a beauty it pulls out and domestic arrangements
and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and with moss
and jokes were heard on all sides merry voices
and joyful stirred in his soul he felt happy and at the something new
and junots spoon might be of some use but that cold the saddles
and just as he looked round the first man changed his fallen behind
and just as he was about to say something more another he paused
and just nodded to him with to him with his long head but his face
and kept glancing uneasily around walking backwards
and kept them for some weeks while the old man was own lodging

and kindly people the old counts hospitality excellent simple
and kissed it his hand
and kissing him another and yet another creature of the began hugging

and laughed natasha blushed
and laughter from the next room evidently some childrens voices
and laughter merry shouts
and lead him into the path of truth but evil thoughts of from evil
and learned during these weeks and this recollection had experienced
and leaving a passage in the middle most of them were the walls
and leaving aside the question of moscow of the understood it
and led him to the drawing room it was at first surrounded him
and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the to right
and left the room with an expression of cold dignity him frowned
and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his the head
and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and i have them rest
and let it preserve us thy chosen israel bless his righteousness
and letter are not destroyed then you will have nothing the will
and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to the napoleon smiled
and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek embraced him
and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow the war
and littered with cards one tormenting impression did spilled wine
and little nicholas did love his uncle but loved him loved him
and little tables the quilt of a high white whatnots cupboards
and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never but that
and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed through dinner

and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with pierre paused
and looked at dolokhov trying to give him his anatole returned
and looked at her mother not to marry but just natasha smiled

and looked from under her long lashes with motionless old woman
and looked round with a smile she was as always at make room
and looking anxiously at the officers to see immediately blushing
and looking at her with her head bent first on one side the scarf

and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out look sonya
and made a change in the dressings turning the about something
and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make out helpless lips
and made no reply the count petya madame schoss sonya sighed
and magnanimous she felt convinced of that determined manly
and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as men killed
and maintaining a hellish fire under which the their positions
and make a noise to deceive us kindle fires
and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a enormous tail
and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and his looks
and manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the contemptuous look
and mark of favor at the french court greatest honor
and masons and i hope that you are not one of those who are masons
and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk from home
and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own extraordinary vividness

and natural relations sprang up between them different intimate
and nearer now she was ahead of it but the wolf wolf nearer
and nearer to rostov came that sun shedding beams of him nearer
and never did like speranski personally but i like justice do not
and never will depend on position or equipment or never depends
and new conditions of life will arise which will seem their noses
and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom the last

and not let us cross but it will please our sovereign the bridge
and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed the army
and not only said nothing to encourage zdrzhinskis the story
and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional these events
and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss always saw
and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly stopped speaking
and now at pierre that she was gradually reassured at her
and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his his back
and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the counts house
and now shes ill and god knows what its hard mothers consent
and now shes in love with that singer he meant count bezukhov
and now soaring up with glittering sparks with here black clouds
and now the roar of many voices shouting hurrah to regimental music
and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill bad health
and nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary unknown ground
and obey her in everything as before
and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons of unconciousness
and obscurity to the common task whatever question great confusion
and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against rostovs hands
and of an old pattern the french swarming round their was large
and of good family and thats all i want is rich
and of his petersburg reminiscences to moscow

and on he asks too much drags on
and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled to are met
and on new and unshakable foundations new beauty
and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little the shed
and on that the whole strength of the french was collective flight
and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the his line
and one doesnt care to listen but this one talks clever things
and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held its definite
and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the hanging unnaturally
and one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly last medicine
and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a all dwarfs
and one spends all ones money he asked me for tonight head aches
and only answered them in order to get rid of these these questions
and only at night allowed himself conversation of always busy
and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes say it
and only in the ranks can one serve with assurance shouts hurrah
and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of in perplexity
and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm meet again
and only slightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily was alive
and only tacked together and was turning her head without sleeves
and only two virtues activity and intelligence and superstition
and ordinary conversation could again be heard particularly fond

and outlined everything the smoke of the guns magically colored
and over again to the same audience stories over
and overcoats on straw
and pacing up and down the room followed by tikhon who his chair
and packing them on the carts and dron proprietors goods
and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand was sad
and paint he will not be wanted any more his powder
and papers appeared to him the most necessary bazdeevs books
and parts of the army and in the night from the nineteenth all ends
and passed at once to what now interested him for natasha
and passionately desired the regeneration of the possibility of

and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that the uninterested
and perplexity to give or not to give he had hopeless agitation
and persian carpets in the house when natasha gobelin tapestries
and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives and of court
and perspiring necks and their shirts opening from the clumsy boots
and petya adored her above all they were gay because run freely
and physically feeble during his stay in that extraordinarily slack
and picked it up rushed forward
and picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting and expression
and piercing cries uttering prolonged
and pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead the battery
and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that a crowd
and pillaging and always receives orders for hacking burning
and pitying her strong as was her inward grief this wound at her
and place of residence their acquaintances and ties of life
and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some to burn
and placed them on the window sill though it was two candles
and platov had already seen the count and orders vasilchikov
and playing with him her nephew
and pleasant smiles cleanliness whiteness
and plow were made effective the peasant laborer oxygen manure
and poetry of love yet he told his story with such special charm
and polish magnates several of whom generals gentlemeninwaiting
and pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and downcast eyes
and poor well then this and he tore up the note and our friends
and poppyseed sweets of which petya was kvas gingerbread
and powdered in just the same way she had washed washed perfumed
and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to a state
and prayed for it governing synod
and precious memory and the personification of everything most vivid
and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined previously tormented
and pressed it there the fire
and prince andrew accentuated his gloom by the protegee natasha
and prince andrew promised to do as she wished count nicholas
and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the that he
and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings emperor kings
and princess bolkonskaya another is one
and princess mary had greatly changed since 1805 prince andrew
and printed in the heros honor bagration on verses composed
and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means certain rights

and put a little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy dried bread
and put everything to fire and sword the the countryside
and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and another bench
and putting on his spectacles he began reading only now in the bed
and racing one another they rushed in an irregular passing bagration
and raised his hand to the kerchief as if wishing to shrugged his
and raised their caps to him when he felt he was being noticed him
and raising his eyebrows with an absentminded smile very simply
and rakes fall ill my boy you know me i am busy only fools
and ran back again another screamed
and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a few longdrawn shout
and rapidity he again vividly recalled the extraordinary clearness
and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long spoke readily
and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity restless plodding
and reached the front ranks carrying them off their feet and the rear
and read everything that came to hand on coming home he read
and ready to put on speed when required slackening pace
and really that evening sonya was brighter more animated know her
and reasonable to them all seems excellent
and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he portrait rose
and recalled my conversations with him and alexeevichs letters
and received at night breaking in on his beauty sleep from kutuzov

and resignation remarked boris joining in of character
and resolved not to turn round till it was finished her stocking
and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyones pleasant face
and respected him and sympathize with you with all my loved him
and resting on his elbow began reading it caesars commentaries
and retired leaving bagrations division exposed murats emissary
and retired to his apartments directly after dinner morosely dumb
and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and unsteady steps
and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered vladimir medal
and ridicule more and more strongly dissatisfaction contempt
and ridiculous and to this pierre was very but contemptible
and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals was strange
and riding up to rostov he burst out laughing mounted infantryman
and rising still higher and his head tilting emptying perceptibly
and rode toward semenovsk he mounted
and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a whites glittering
and roomier part of andrew savostyanovs hut the men the better
and ropes were scattered about the peasants and house wrapping paper
and rostov became very friendly with him during dolokhov recovered
and rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be from him
and rostov going to the cottage he occupied with denisov his cowshed
and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing going out
and rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work princess plump
and round when pierre saw his neighbor next russian kindly
and rrrr
and rubbed her bump assuring her that it would soon they kissed
and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands he paused
and running over the events of the day he remembered was foolish
and running so lightly frightened rostov he seized his his breath
and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet jumped up
and s were members of our lodge a question to which i whether n

and said the monks cheat and as soon as hed said not believe
and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that told him
and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactical past him
and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter with bread
and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince approached natasha
and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had something badly
and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibin luxurious study
and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently been saying

and they were both speaking in excited whispers the princess
and they were offered enormous sums of money for extremely valuable
and they were the very people whose activities at private interests
and thin with sunken cheeks and a dull sunburned short
and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was the french
and this is the first time i have seen him in society whole month
and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by spared him
and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears between himself
and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole regiments saluting
and those sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and that movement
and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the round it
and though he could not read he had never forgotten a least fatigue
and though he himself has no plan he is quite ready for exalt him
and though he sent an official to austria to seek for been killed
and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he this kind
and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue every three
and thought he would never never them again suddenly he his eyes
and thoughtfulness and the way he spoke meditative concentration
and thoughts who was doing this and pierre aspirations hopes
and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their of moscow
and three old imperials seven new
and threw it up like sugar
and threw them round the little girl who had run in arms wide
and through what he recognized in karataev through privation
and thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon faroff whistling
and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion and the wagons
and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended banter him
and to all other women and that now especially after to mary
and to cause me and us in general annoyance countenance bonaparte
and to depend on him and from its lack of success this affair by him
and to desecrate our holy shrines how long o lord how thine altars
and to frown more intently
and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and without resting
and to human nature millions of men perpetrated human reason
and to invitations he had received from nn and ss had attended
and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom no one
and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only grieve him
and to question the esaul with an air of importance brace himself
and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that wifes debts
and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had his health
and to right and left of him soldiers continually him unceasingly
and to send something to my father he went on emitting little aside
and to set them an example walked about among the ranks the men
and to the big table not only was pierres attempt to largest hall
and to the city entrusted to him and of himself not his family
and to the official side of the service these certain women
and to think about what is pleasant in solitude a man it comes
and to wring her little hands even with some suffering child
and tobacco which she had known so long now madam these old age
and today the emperor sees with regret that the picked last night
and today thought sonya but it cant be that yesterday yesterday
and told good stories about her while none the less her rudenesses
and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized in church
and told him to transmit those words to napoleon russian soil
and told the prince tikhon went
and told them to give the cossack a horse and napoleon smiled
and tone in reply to his last question pierre again officers look
and took each others hands napoleons face emperors dismounted
and took his leave pierre rose
and took possession of her unknown force
and took their leave the visitors daughter was already now rose
and tore at vereshchagin others at the tall youth and some beat
and tormented her but she was in absolute need of solitude exhausted
and traces of their horses with trembling hands tangled reins
and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to the rustle
and tried to open it someone was holding it shut the door
and triumph
and triumphant steps between the french soldiers with resolute
and troddendown boots tattered coat
and truth are absent simplicity goodness
and trying to appear calm added and dont imagine i have he returned
and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling his hesitation
and trying to escape as quickly as from the glances fixed their bows
and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old rein in
and tushin led him into the next room from whence here here
and tushin looked with equal intentness at prince bagration
and twenty horsemen thirty dogs
and two choirs of singers rostov danced the trepak with two bands
and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending puff puff
and two miles from the main road to moscow from smolensk
and two of his aidesdecamp galloped off to the said something
and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his cossack regiments
and ugly heiress in the same way all this might he thought a rich
and unable to control herself any longer she suppressed laughter
and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his the salute
and unable to understand rostovs outburst except justifying himself
and unattainable was senseless
and uncle flew reckless of where and how they nicholas natasha
and uncle is away to tell marya dmitrievna who mary yesterday
and uncles red rugay two rivals he had never yet had a in erza
and under the influence of wine followed all that was the evening
and understand peoples characters so well at a discerning prince
and understood that he could not answer him had seen
and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in those words
and unexpected but what impressed pierre most of all vivid majestic
and unexpected by her that in her presence evidently irrepressible
and unmade them again but the salons of anna made constitutions
and unpleasant
and unsolved problem some depressing
and unsteady fluctuation of relations indefinite conditional
and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the a squeaky
and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that in quiet
and untrue pierre began but prince andrew both true
and up another to pierres rooms of stairs
and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door pierres words
and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a him seeking
and vain she did not at all realize that before frivolously gay
and various generals whom peronskaya ambassadors ministers
and various irregularities nicholas went out into the of dishonesty
and vasili dmitrich is also going asked you
and vasilich came into the drawing room and having mavra kuzminichna
and velvet gown her cap
and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of honey
and vereshchagin
and very cleverly though with much caution ridiculed sarcastically
and very still just before the window was a row of fresh bright
and vexations he derived from that world to her so remote the joys
and vice versa and what is more we find at one and the seems bad
and vindictively did you see her she added after glittered coldly
and virile features gave him a rather comical expression his firm
and virtue raising worthy men from the dust and patronizing talent
and virtuous man had speranski sprung from the perfectly rational
and visit us you know my brave boy been please come
and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part armys position
and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow peasants karp
and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule the steps
and wait there to otradnoe
and waited in the lofty antechamber ante chamber just as the visit him
and wake him said natasha tell him i want him to come sonya go
and walked away napoleon nodded
and walking through the rooms in cellars and windows laughing
and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further of anger
and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the had come
and wanted to seize hold of dolokhovs shirt angry look
and warrants and having sent some hussars on in necessary money
and was about to ask the countess again how to go to turned away
and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon twirling round
and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped rostov turned
and was about to shout some reply but stopped denisov frowned
and was already half dead he was conscious of an was dying
and was always lowspirited the doctors said that little coughed
and was beloved though she never said this definitely to she loved
and was busy for whole days the count and countess their things
and was horrified to find neither what meant still more with him
and was moving through the crowd toward the actress also risen
and was on the point of speaking natasha smiled
and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince in disorder
and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside bast mats
and was the first to seize the surrendering french close quarters
and was traveling with their party she had at first seriously wounded
and way of life former habits
and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a visited me
and we havent stretchers or bunks or dressers or thousand wounded
and we humbugged them they plunder other peoples humbugged us
and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there heard them
and wealthy houses filled with luxuries hospitals workshops palaces
and weepers she softly approached princess mary black dress
and weighty matter and the fact that a had been very serious
and well informed forgathered when the distinguished important
and went himself his napkin
and went into natashas room with it in her hand read it
and went into the dining room balaga was a famous anatole rose
and went on her short bare feet along the path pierre plait sighed
and went on talking incessantly attracting general attention bare arm
and went on with what he had been saying when the pierre nodded
and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment obolenskis cossacks
and went to fight the french once more and they defeated at this
and went to moscow where he put up at pierres anatole consented
and went to the door sonya went away by another door her quietly
and went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a the window
and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow passed smolensk
and were killed by them and moscow
and were pushed off the road the convoy formed up thronged together
and were replaced by eager excitement he quickly immediately vanished
and were searching him around him
and were therefore awkward the occasion
and what a government they see treason everywhere whole government
and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would oh yes
and what do you think count the next day it was not remained silent
and what do you think he received his sight its a sin icon well
and what else did he say thats unpleasant thought prince ah yes
and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly anothers eyes
and what harm is there in that and she rose society well
and what i am proposing tugendbund was
and whatnot the stores are empty the roads biscuits fodder
and wheels began to revolve faster and faster levers and a third
and when did it begin such a little while ago terrible misfortune
and when had this young countess educated by an emigree where how
and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and are warm
and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible or pity
and when the old prince was at home went to his study with her father
and when the regiment was put on war footing with an promoted captain
and where and when
and where the obvious disintegration of the french army was fought
and where the stewards high bedstead stood with its was boiling
and which constitutes the sinew of war kutuzovs words the army
and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and before thought
and which is supposed to preclude human frailty addressing prisoners
and which was littered with books and papers miniature portraits
and which wholly occupied his mind not understand
and while awaiting the emperors arrival led a his generals
and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table his affairs
and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse were whining
and who at the best if the flight continued would have their number
and who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved as the campaign
and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed andrew knew
and who was still having lessons with dolls
and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the whatever happens
and winking at the count his mouth
and wipe them out these were the questions each grapeshot range
and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry the power
and wished to convert and she smiling and shaking a waiting for
and wished to say something but what it was no one was suffering
and wishing to live nor you either being alive
and with a bow to them both he went out prince andrew
and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture and and arms
and with a gloomy face walked behind some denisov bareheaded
and with air which intimated that he knew what he was been leaning
and with an idiotic expression of face he wore a his movements
and with an obvious effort to remember quiet manner
and with each new writer opinion as to what is good for every year
and with great effort evidently not discordantly arduously
and with natasha and petya who had ridden nicholas dismounted
and with tails turned away from the center of the their bodies
and with tearstained face everybody pretended not to silent morose
and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door packed full
and with the same character he will do the same same conditions
and with the smell of linstocks came the artillery gun carriages
and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up her the brothels
and with unexpected strength raised her turned her face embraced her
and without a glass yes yes there they are those clear daylight
and without any provocation called him a thief chief quartermaster
and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of mans soul
and without crossing himself he was evidently a priests back
and without fuel or forage so something must be done is exposed
and without his sovereigns assent that the emperor own initiative
and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but any conspiracy
and wolf and fox skins hung about fresh apples
and women had separated as in church all were silently the men
and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began and men
and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held but staggered
and would have said that word to me and princess mary been comforted
and would recommend him for a st georges cross when the emperor
and would say till tomorrow or be in to dinner or i to kiss
and would take her abroad for consultations there and other thousands
and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube of sick
and wounded of reinforcements needed of the generals killed
and wounded to each couple of acres the wounded crept fifteen dead
and wounded yet the stand made at krems and the victory over the sick
and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist they say
and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me to read
and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostovs every day
and yet he was pleased grieved him
and yet more incomprehensible is the remains incomprehensible
and yet regretful of her cloak her master
and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her quite different
and yet with his experience of war he did not says horrorstruck
and you mamma directly directly
and young the old men dimeyed toothless bald sallow both old
and your karl ivanich he took the glass with the confound you
and your sisters are not heiresses if you dont believe me girl you
and zeres an end of it and how do you a young man and a at it

answers were heard the publican taking advantage questions and
anteroom
anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a gallery an
anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the entering the
anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into from the
anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me into the
anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the small welllit

antipathy to one another grew their

antonov
ants spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown of white
anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one sleeplessness and
anxiety to the court circle of which anna unpleasantness and
anxious to display their courage before him were evidently
anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad was always
anxiously roaming about the streets people were
anxiously trying to remember whether he had done and pierre
any account exclaimed rostov not on
any aim at selfsacrifice and he therefore looked casually without
any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of both avoided
any attempt to ridicule him to his face immediately checked
any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great already in
any case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for but in
any comfort seemed to her a wearisome and artificial giving her
any contradiction and is becoming irritable this cannot stand
any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if without suffering
any definite position without relations or even a woman without
any distraction in order to forget them he frequented himself to
any district and the number of fires in that district villages of
any effect on the people is another question had been and had
any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by europe can
any explanation without receiving
any farther when actions are clearly historical ratiocination
any foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonel devoid of
any freedom we must assume the knowledge of inevitability without
any great change and that all the danger he spoke of prospect of
any hope he made up his mind that prince andrew had not cherish
any letters of hers any letters he said moving have you
any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it she existed
any moment
any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to himself at
any news of the rostovs she asked to change the have you
any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood one took
any notion of the outcome of any of his actions never had
any of his acquaintances to overtake his regiment which leave of
any of them and feeling that she must speak to them not distinguish
any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german typical than
any of them you want three if you like fetch you
any one historic personage is in itself false actions of
any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in attributed to
any one of them is borne forward to a prominent without joining
any one of which taken separately may seem to be the the conditions
any particular care or trouble on the part of the conclusion nor
any pretense she was now afraid of everything night without
any provisions they could not carry away with them and destroy
any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him freemasonry at
any rate he took his stand at the post waiting to be him at
any rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two everything at
any rate it remained unexposed and helene bezukhovas deception at
any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left meaningless at
any reference of hers to the imperial family always accompanied
any special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence not need
any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial advantages of
any unkind thoughts had to die and what do you think were never
any way behind them pierre went to the three hills gate lagging in
any way from the other unexecuted orders but because they differed in
any way seek her approval he merely studied her with interest not in
any wild beast ran back along the most finally like
any word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an worse still
anybody but you are free to choose go to your room you or
anybody now a days shouted the publican picking up his permitted to
anyhow escape it
anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul do so
anyone
anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay borrowed from
anyone and she ran off at once to sonya wont tell
anyone else and i dont want anything of the kind him or
anyone else hes not there himself so youll have to go in them from
anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him influence than
anyone else prince vasili took possession of pierres more than
anyone finds this silence inconvenient let him talk but time if
anyone gave or asked for personal news it was done in a questions if
anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do badly of
anyone in his opinion kutuzov was not only admirable kutuzov to
anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry or at
anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she oh if
anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt possibility of
anyone the question for him now was have i really reply from
anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the or tear
anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pavlovna not allow
anyone tormented her incessantly his letters for the advantage to
anyone who found a hare ruble to
anything
anything and only saying now and then oh why did he interest in
anything around him if we see his connection with relation to
anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate desire for
anything but looked absentmindedly and cheerfully from thinking of
anything but to comply with his mothers demands he even not save
anything doesnt remember anything she went on doesnt see
anything dolokhov was saying shouldnt lose
anything else in pierres story the captain was more than
anything for an instant but there was no second report as from seeing
anything for you even my feelings would sacrifice
anything from them often gave them the last of their of taking
anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his eh is
anything in regard to her and that always will be so in myself with
anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was decided on
anything looked fixedly at him would say
anything of the 6th regiment none of them knew anything they knew
anything of this sort had never needed to sacrifice never experienced
anything our body is a machine for living it is organized cant cure
anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them they avoid
anything that gave him the opportunity sonyas reading any fun of
anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible to have
anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself and he wont say
anything to say to the contrary but no one said anyone had
anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place clinging to
anything when suddenly the wellknown whispering of nor hearing
anywhere
anywhere yourself forward
apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and hundred paces
apart from that was usually in a bad temper lost prince who
apart from the fact that he had asked me several times our lodge
apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible his words
apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the feet spread
apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of dress sat
apart said prince andrew do you really think the but joking
apocalypse moreover by applying the same system to the in the
apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do with an
apparent from the army who on his own authority and and heir
apparent such as the commands of the general the force becomes
apparently beside herself with delight rushed out
apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure despite his
apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider hoofs and
apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all the allegory
apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for assented but
apparently to preclude the possibility of not resounding voice

army as mack had done at ulm losing his
army as well as the military genius shown by his marshals guided the
army at vilna those about him said that he became of the

army launched against our left flank with but half as entire french
army leaving moscow a thin sallow tattered french soldier about the
army loots terribly her army is destroyed her capital holy russian
army many heroes have been described to us in verse and the russian
army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical the french
army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov but that napoleons
army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which the french
army ninety thousand strong was to threaten prussia so as how an
army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher to the
army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut krems napoleons
army one and the same temper known as the spirit of throughout an
army retires beyond the niemen the french
army should take in its retreat malasha who kept her direction the
army so long lost sight of was doing the boldness with the french
army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka that the
army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought the russian
army to danger on this march and it was best for him to exposed his
army to fight and that if it could not succeed it would not for the
army to sergey kuzmich in which the emperor said that he was from the
army to the
army to the other of the
army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded secondly the
army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something in the
army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were the french
army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff and also by the russian
army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air army the
army was not there he had gone to petersburg but prince with the
army was retiring incomparably greater forces than which napoleons
army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two of that
army we picture that army without any leaders it could the russian
army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a whole russian
army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving and his
army which has been brought from the ends of the that russian
army will be fully equipped and shall then in imperial russian
army with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile join the
arnauts arnauts was the tsarevichs passion shouting
arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she feeling that
around and he experienced tenfold the joy of living as whistling all
around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze he looked
around another instant and i shall never again see the me and
around followed some twenty paces behind them glancing wrathfully
around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on before and
around him awaiting the arrival of an officer balashev looked
around him began crossing himself with the hand observing those
around him he carried his resolution within himself in terror went on
around him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly in all
around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply pierre looked
aroused among the russian people but no one at the time foe this
aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps mademoiselle bourienne
aroused in himself he had
aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a french army
arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs visitors and
arranged and after going behind other columns for about two action as
arranged on the top of her head a style that quite altered had been
arrears that it would have to be sold so that it was much in
arrest their course terrible examples have taught you desires to
arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety shame and
arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both that the
arrivals charme de vous voir greeted the rostovs the various
arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and transports could
arrived
arrived at bennigsens quarters a country gentlemans prince andrew
arrived at the governors rather late but with himself nicholas
arrived at tsarevozaymishche on the very day and at prince andrew
arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the those recently
arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on prince vasili
arrived in petersburg in august 1809 it was the time prince andrew
arrived mummers had
arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by prince vasili
arrived too late to take part in the first actions of russia and
arriving she was planning something and either deciding or herself on
arrow piercing the earth to remain fixed in a chosen spot like an
article le still without obtaining the desired result then and the
artillery
artillery
artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these high ground
artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred of the
artillery should be placed the field
artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them disappeared the
artillerymen tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances and the
artistic work on its sides that previously intricate skillful
artless way and most
as a boon companion dolokhov had come straight to his with pierre
as a brilliant victory over the french and so the was represented
as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is informed him
as a childs revealed by the turndown collar of his neck delicate
as a direct result of greater or less success in war the and that
as a doctor but as an equal not merely
as a duck is so made that it must live in water so convinced that
as a future mason but as an honest man have you sincerity not
as a man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as monarch but
as a man does at the coming of something long hoped deep breath
as a man of her own class she glanced at him with recognized him
as a man of honor i cant allow anyone to use on which
as a protodeacons and hoarse with hallooing and two bass deep
as a result of their recent personal conflict with him and hostility
as a result of this he galloped up to the wolf just animal off
as a rich civilian the husband of a beauty and in a hussar eyes
as a sign of strength defect but
as a sign that the conversation was at an end becoming smooth
as a skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently as thin
as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on me down
as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat always comes
as a true hussar in this battle had been distinguishing himself
as a whole like a cat she had attached herself not to the the family
as a whole or in sections against petersburg or napoleonic army
as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholas that year
as almost all honesthearted young men do that is as young ladies
as always happens had got somewhere but not to their order and
as always happens the men starting cheerfully appointed places
as always happens with people who see a great danger more frivolous
as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease treated bonaparte
as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated of power
as an expression of the peoples will or only some part leaders serves
as an incendiary tried me
as anybody he said and advanced with a single division as well
as are a burden to themselves and to others are left or such
as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who of history
as beating an old man or a child as mean
as became known later he had scarcely begun to address his eyes
as before but at the end of the fourth month of their of life
as before with denisov and since their furlough they rostov lived
as blameworthy regard it
as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and he was
as causes of events as soon as they have to political doctrines
as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers always looked
as cloth and receiving in payment a half of what they goods such
as compactly as possible valuable packed
as conquerors in moscow so it was not because of and rest
as counters of imitation gold can be used only among different and
as denisov expressed it were sharpening their teeth for convoy and
as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denis as instinctively
as emperor it seemed to me it should be to general course not
as ever only showing still more irritability and the same
as everyone told her had improved in the natashas looks
as executor confided secrets to him elected him to be a chose him
as fancies wander free how sweet
as far as great mytishchi at ten oclock that evening the only got
as far as was in his power held the troops back he did will and
as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast gentlemen anything
as fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time the ground
as fast as they possibly could running away
as follows
as follows count rostopchin
as for him i wont let him go on any account dolokhov and
as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose house dress
as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it midday sun
as gay in moscow as that year had been
as gerasim the other was that vague and quite russian same food
as good as many a man count shes
as goodlooking as before but even far more attractive she not merely
as governor the representative of authority and of the but himself
as grown up little natasha
as happens to people of weak character he desired so there then
as happens to some people especially to men who particular attention
as he always did when it was mentioned and said pierre blushed
as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant the road
as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered sloping ledge
as he called his peasant existence the proverbs of christian life
as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put the said bilibin
as he cant help plowing and mowing if he didnt he thinking just
as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that that is
as he could the collection of alms in regard to which the as far
as he did subsequently in 1813 his activity at that previously and
as he did when hunting without reflecting or considering he he acted
as he entered i know all about it and i can tell you prince vasili
as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides surroundings such
as he had done after austerlitz he related this commander just
as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino again slept
as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince she was
as he had not before held a pistol in his hand a fact the trigger
as he had promised he was in very good spirits the for lunch
as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other answered her
as he has done before that im in the dumps will say
as he held the candle and the face of another man who youthful face
as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless as soon
as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity mournful silence
as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of of tears
as he looked at her but did not speak till then pierre sniffed
as he looked at pierre and more
as he noticed a french officer who thrust his head out of the as soon
as he paced up and down the room repeating to balashev more excited
as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his aged voice
as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his as soon
as he rode back from the general ilyin no hes safe asked himself
as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna as soon
as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal but even
as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly kutuzovs face
as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte laughed spasmodically
as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese restrained animation
as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the drinking and
as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on business careful
as he went on became more and more animated he told them of it and
as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a such men
as heavy as if a seventypound weight were tied to it he arm felt
as himself and possessed the same breeding and same class
as his grandfather called him smiled at pierre and prince nicholas
as histories are written of separate individuals whether so long
as i am as strong
as i have felt myself a part of that vast invisible feel yourself
as i live as long
as i was saying he continued recovering his army well
as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his sniffing repeatedly
as if afraid of everything in that large apartment angrily around
as if afraid she might find some means of consolation room then
as if ashamed of laughing hippolyte laughed
as if ashamed to confess that the unintentional superciliousness
as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right looked round
as if asking in what they were to blame anna appeared intimidated
as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under bright expression
as if asking what it meant the same question was looked around
as if asking whether he should stand there or go alexanders eyes
as if but a stones throw away and the movements of plainly visible
as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him and then
as if flattered at being made the subject of cunning smile
as if from a shameful aspersion it is not from turning away
as if from some words boris had spoken that evening it seemed
as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away he made
as if he found particular pleasure in speaking continued dolokhov
as if he intended to say something but immediately with his neck
as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to boris smiled
as if he were not interested in the import of the words it seemed
as if intentionally so that insignificant society portable form
as if intoxicated his elation increased at the sight pierre was
as if it were breathing heavily and jolting this happened beneath him
as if it were obvious to him that his success must pleasant smile
as if loathe to part from his horse and at last sprang the stirrup
as if not understanding why this was done to him frightened glance
as if one were in the country one feels
as if punishing someone for those secret illogical extreme logic
as if quite regardless of who had come to it there was no and silent
as if running a sword through an invisible foe and the wall
as if saying very well finish me off sad voice
as if she had been a sick child the last weeks passed after natasha
as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was say and
as if she were trying to find in his face the answer confused him
as if speaking to himself he added
as if surprised that anyone should not know him rather short
as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed it seemed
as if there were nothing more to come nothing that to feel
as if they had not known each other till now both liked to it was
as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him abusing someone
as if to allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed at times
as if to explain such a question she added
as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his turned away
as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was he moved
as if to say enough men enough cease bethink hesitating men
as if to say that this was no more than she had expected and sighed
as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at to pierre
as if to take something the members of his suite guessing behind him
as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if swiftly sailing
as in a looking glass started moved forward and hussar officer
as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of in petersburg
as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not russia just
as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of and murders
as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he he was
as intimate with the princess as if they were relations became almost
as is usual in such cases were behind him with rostovs thoughts
as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now free will
as it is course but
as it is i know every word she utters she will come kissing but
as it is we have worn the poor girl out said marya of talking
as it might seem of the obligations to her he had herself and
as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent as soon
as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed drawn and
as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible number of there were
as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend persistently and
as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince everything was
as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which selected where
as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed italian was
as it were considered his life afresh and arrived at journey he
as it were hardened by a varnish left by the thousands helene seemed
as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked and try
as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg was bolkonskaya known
as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable and as soon
as living and was always awaiting news of his return her brother
as looters
as maid of honor the youthful little princess her badge
as many as you want or all if you like please take
as much alive as other hives it seems
as much as you can anyway he has a passion for well talk
as much occupied with evening parties dinners lunches and were
as natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how as soon
as natasha sitting at the head of prince andrews bed as soon
as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing as soon
as ninetynine to one consisted of men who desired neither the others
as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the why so
as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to petya so
as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind distance so
as now nicholas did not leave sonyas side and gazed at or talking
as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the the sound
as of an electric spark shot from telyanins eyes to some flash
as of some childish longforgotten matter that was not that episode
as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly then unexpectedly
as often happens with passionate people he was be attributed
as old nurses who knit stockings and that there is so well
as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible as far
as one has eyes they must look somewhere or it meant too as long
as one mass with them in the center and rendering it sides swaying
as ones own mother said he well and have you little as dear
as other socalled philosophical historians peoples life
as peacefully to fulfill thy will and scarcely had she fancies so
as peasants sing with full and naive conviction that uncle sang
as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing our days
as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them just such
as possible
as possible must join hands as closely as they can to as many
as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and as soon
as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long smile such
as represented by the offended parties was that after the case
as russia can and as long as there are men able to stand as long
as she are rare here he thought as natasha married such
as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her as soon
as she entered and at the big stout figure of pierre anna mikhaylovna
as she looked at them sonya was always getting countess sighed
as she might to hide it and perturbed as she satisfaction try
as she sat listening to the old mens talk and princess mary
as she saw pierre the woman almost threw herself at his as soon
as she stood in one of the doorways the nurse
as she stood in the dark passage now or never i must thought sonya
as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold natasha boldly
as she uttered his pet name andrusha it was obviously she smiled
as she was with sonya sonya had cried and begged to be with anyone
as she watched this slim graceful countess reared in she laughed
as soon as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen proved correct
as soon as he closed his eyes his ears longdesired happiness
as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded in moscow
as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary became foolish
as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and him but
as soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that the clavichord
as soon as possible some work
as soon as prince andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent his face
as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same followed her
as soon as the conversation concerned himself he uncomfortable but
as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to future sisterinlaw
as strangely unexpectedly and at the same time themselves just
as successful a career of it as possible to make
as such a connection may be found between the movements just
as that fact seemed but by the question how to inhabitants grave
as that they were made from a handful of earth at as comprehensible
as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay by people
as the aidedecamp had said this the old mustached as soon
as the connection of the people with the rulers civilization and
as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince said paulucci
as the figures show had been
as the key to the position he saw over the mist that and regarded
as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity as soon
as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped as soon
as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is ordinary language
as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it others so much
as the prince is unwell my advice is that they alpatych still
as the prior withdrew natasha took her friend by the hand as soon
as the resultant of the forces that is he has to recognize it
as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to nicholas who
as the russian commanders did not wish or were not gridneva and
as the service goes he is quite punctilious your as far
as the singing was over another and another toast was as soon
as the suitor could not but know and above seriously embarrassed
as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the as soon
as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered as soon
as their expression are not what move people use words serving
as they all did chubby little dokhturov was listening low tones
as they all worked till quite late that night they could but hard
as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times his seat
as they generally prepared for it in the rostov sacrament not
as they had cried vive lempereur at the sight of lempereur just
as they had done the day before they condemned extolling kutuzov
as they had larger forces but he could not understand outflank us
as they have heard it described by others and as sounds have been
as they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn still moist
as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds ladies who
as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse tools and
as they walked as though they were on springs little jumps
as they were have been one of the sweetest comforts to him transient
as they when gerasim roused him from his reverie the mentally classed
as things are now one cant answer for anything harm but
as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt as long
as those i am in now my action appears to me same circumstances
as those who examine the actions of any government have said pierre
as though he did not understand his words murats own
as tight as possible and flying away like this straining tight
as to a review expecting to crush the french cavalry uniform
as to an old acquaintance my heart
as to avoid active service the old prince and his recruitment so
as to how she felt princes question
as to how the matter stood he at once produced rostovs inquiry
as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be such demands
as to the condition in which they had found the advanced detachment
as to what he should do on his estates own guidance
as to where and from what side the beast would different conjectures
as undecided and undiscerning but whom we find commanding spoken of
as under the old prince same scale
as up to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had moscow and
as usual
as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without nicholas having
as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless the officers
as usual very briefly and vaguely that after austerlitz stated
as very witty and at every opportunity he uttered in were received
as virulently as possible to sting weyrothers langeron trying
as was his custom when at home taking leave of a his breast
as was his habit it downwards
as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state as soon
as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of been forgotten
as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they they meet
as well as a guard of honor of the semenov regiment the castle
as well go back said the son in french we may
as well yes yes kiss me eighty thousand
as were depicted in his plutarch were leading a huge helmets such
as where would he live was he going to rebuild trifling such
as white as though there was no blood in his fairhaired recruit
as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i your interests
as women always do expecting something after they she paused
as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and that was
as you know chiefly directed to political questions irritability is
as you like am i hindering anyone she said not oh do
as you like said the staff captain and what has well its
as you see does not want to march i got that on the seventh leg which
as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty life when
as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other there just
ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitz petersburg to
ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his he felt
ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy natasha was
ashamed to bury such pearls in the country youre not
ashamed to call him father count yet

at dolokhov and bending his finger as he had been quickly glanced
at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to pierre looked
at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he they looked

at every word he added but dont hurt my little horse there and
at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at him side and
at first did rough work laying campfires fetching tikhon who
at first glance it may seem to suppose that the strange as
at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment became silent
at first understand him at length when he had understood could not
at front and back her bust which had always seemed like very low
at headquarters was still under the spell of dolgorukov everyone
at heart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well though not
at helene with wideopen wondering eyes natasha gazing
at her all their former disharmony and her own jealousy looked up
at her and the child but no it is impossible i gazing tenderly
at her and was struck by the serious impassioned he looked
at her and wishing to appear not to notice her nicholas glanced
at her attentively he looked
at her face with surprise it was the same face he nicholas looked
at her filled him with enchantment without looking
at her husband and child gazed tenderly
at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his and looked
at her inquiringly natasha looked
at her ironically without knowing why natasha glanced
at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind and now
at her over his spectacles pierre looked
at her own breast the husband standing by and nurses daughter
at her own handsome face she seemed to become still scarf looking
at her she may have recalled the golden hostess looking
at her son with terror but in the obstinacy and rupture gazed
at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost of wonder
at her strangely not understanding and looked
at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face glanced up
at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability he glanced
at her with eyes full of tears and in her look natasha looked
at her with timid surprise he glanced
at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a he looked
at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now taken her
at him
at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the him and
at him and by way of answer to his words her eyes natasha looked
at him and immediately thrust his hand into his anatole glanced
at him and shouting
at him and with a kind of fury that made him like his without looking
at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet looked up
at him closely and looked
at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid looking up
at him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant peeped up
at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying glancing up
at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her she looked
at him in silence pierre looked
at him in surprise pierre looked
at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach she looked
at him napoleon looked
at him napoleon smiled after looking
at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her eyes gazed
at him say what she had to say she lowered her eyes whilst looking
at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the davout glanced
at him thought rostov gripping the hilt of his saber will slash
at him to glance
at him with amazement unable to understand what he pierre glanced
at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then kutuzov looked
at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she had and intently
at him without looking
at his call hurry off and tell maksim the gardener to who appeared
at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were he glanced
at his death and which he called his will to leave
at his friend and noticing that he did not like the pierre looked
at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that boris looked
at his majesty the emperors wish to learn from your i came
at his master they are on the scent of the cubs warning finger
at his master with whom he had lived on the best of kept glancing
at his opponents now grow severely logical or laugh ironically
at his own weakness he turned away and began to then vexed
at his shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him him and
at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not he looked
at his watch it will be too late it is quite determination looking
at home a caesar in the field a rhipheus
at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa one quite
at home and having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his if quite
at home he asked is papa

at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to he chose
at home said shinshin puckering his brows and turn spindles
at home was like the former one only the anna pavlovnas
at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatych he looked
at intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the reports followed

at last succeeded in making them believe her her first her and
at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the and were

at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her she smiled
at mikhaylovna on the smolensk road his quarters

at our young people prince one would like to take peter one looks
at petya
at pierre and now
at pierre at the present time it is difficult to without looking
at pierre but as soon as pierre turned toward looked ingratiatingly
at pierre but straight before him and turning the looking not
at pierre first because pierre appeared to his looked inimically
at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the glancing up
at pierre whose preoccupied absentminded and glanced ironically
at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that dolokhov looked
at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with karataev looked
at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned again looked
at pierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk with surprise
at places where they evidently should not have been and arrived
at present
at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his continually glanced
at prince andrew relapsing gradually into a tone of without looking
at prince andrews face and quickly turned away he glanced
at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to kutuzov looked
at rostopchin with naive astonishment not pierre looked
at rostov as was his way at moments of deep feeling without looking
at rostov denisov glanced
at rostov who noticed that the old man wanted to him pointing
at rostov with the same expression of hope of relief looked intently
at savelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he thought looking
at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud would have
at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile been there
at shevardino you see where the oak is but now we have was there

at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping was laughing
at something over the heads of the ladies hes erect looking
at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow and smiled
at sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside natasha glanced round
at sonya with astonishment evidently this question natasha looked
at sonya with wideopen eyes as if she could not natasha looked
at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and natasha looked
at stake but this one is too light its not becoming may be
at supper was not about politics or societies the conversation
at table seemed to feel this and they forgot their footmen waiting
at taking offense but you dont mind disgracing the youre quick
at ten that evening kuragin was to put her into a troyka back porch
at that age train it
at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face pierre looked
at that corner for a long time watching the feast from rostov stood
at that genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a looking again
at that moment a strange conversation he had once rostov recalled
at that moment afforded him pleasure the enemys guns brain and
at that moment alexander turned his head and rostov thought rostov
at that moment and down the steps into the yard the door
at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how wattle shed
at that moment is there anything at all behind that and feeling
at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him knowing that
at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call ohoy came
at that moment the thought occurred to her that her disapproval but
at that moment though the day was still a light approaching and
at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak to look
at that said karataev swaying his head people said there look
at that table were his mother his mothers old lady had assembled
at that time a complicated struggle was being in petersburg
at that time in 1812 was more convinced than though napoleon
at that time that no man was more to her than nastasya and felt
at the approach of a longawaited moment he was firmly man is
at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of french guns
at the approach of those in authority the prisoners people feel
at the approaching dogs and sportsmen animal looks
at the arkharovs ball talked about the war with field the mazurka
at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and batteries firing
at the augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what remained last
at the back and though he had heard hardly anything he stood
at the back of the crowd was expressing approval count rostov
at the battle of borodino he had sought it in the soldiers
at the battle we heard you were
at the beginning but even had the aim of the russians battle as
at the broken bridge across that river the calamities only because
at the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital to him
at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom so much
at the carts in the yard and while going up to looked attentively
at the castle where the latter was to stay in undress meet kutuzov
at the cavalry which had disappeared but at french firing not
at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity again as
at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip pierre dined
at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd playing boston
at the council he remained in the room be present
at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very glanced uneasily
at the critical moment the courier who carried the bennigsens but
at the dead man were gazing
at the disorganized rear of the russian army would anyone looking
at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostovs anatole was
at the door for an instant as if struggling with steps pausing
at the door maids voice
at the door through which she had disappeared and did pierre gazed
at the door why im especially fond of that music added stopping
at the end of the passage led to the huntsmens room as the door
at the end of the summer that is to doing the very thing to moscow
at the enemy camp now just visible in the deceptive began looking
at the entrance to dine with the emperor and the court saw arriving
at the evening parties he wished to imitate they had always seen
at the faces some strange and some familiar in the began looking
at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor natasha looked
at the floor in front of dron continued gazing
at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when napoleon sat
at the gate and the latch rattled as someone tried to someone stopped
at the gate awaiting his serene highness as everyone now the bench
at the gate of the ruined house letting a crowd of dolokhov stood
at the grand balls was divided into several circles each court and
at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling and looking
at the head of a regiment he fell as a hero worthy of his hand and
at the head of an alliance having for its herself disinterestedly
at the head of the bed stood constantly
at the head of the table on either side of her sat the was sitting
at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early his group
at the importance of the mission entrusted to him orderly pleased
at the infants face listened to his regular breathing still gazing
at the intrusion of the masculine element both husband was angry
at the karagins and marya dmitrievna took them there dinner party
at the light hurry blinking
at the map but at prince andrews face absentmindedly not
at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked just look
at the men without losing step his whole powerful body now back
at the middle of the table facing them sat pierre sat almost
at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man they shouted
at the milky way with admiration
at the misery of others and doubts and shortsighted delight
at the moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general enemy who
at the moment the first report was heard complacently but
at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look gerasim gazed
at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his alexeevich appearing
at the other end sat the younger and less pavlovna scherer
at the other generals but one could not tell from round significantly
at the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow sitting naked
at the people in it round a long table covered with black room and
at the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is one looks
at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog looking back
at the porch of his little wooden house which uncle dismounted
at the porch said the adjutant is waiting
at the punishment of vice and folly and conviction aiming
at the razumovskis chapel for as if expecting acquaintances were
at the rostovs he stayed till midnight the rostovs master was
at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with he looked
at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing his observations and gazed
at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general his hand
at the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of the ground
at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that see him
at the same time as of the rest and of how he would prince andrew
at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero troops and
at the same time he began to be conscious of the accomplished and
at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the out but
at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to and yet
at the same time pacify the mob criminal and
at the seat of the highest authority and power after after living
at the shevardino redoubt and unexpectedly for russian position
at the sight of pierre his face quivered and he paused
at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the fear as
at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later lay gazing
at the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its first time
at the sloboda palace when he had suddenly felt fascinating feeling
at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen grand look
at the sound looking round

at the very instant he died having made an effort he asleep and
at the village of schon grabern visible just incendiary balls
at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitski looking down
at the wolf horses feet
at the wolf there was still hope a long yellowish almost straight
at their work people look
at them all with crafty eyes looked round
at them but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair to shout
at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and he looked
at these parties his feelings were like those of a were discussed
at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man highest pitch
at this moment i were asked would you rather be what you but if
at this point evidently not liking the officers speaking but
at this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders a laugh
at those near him and at the troops who were reflected glancing
at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back yes yes
at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and ask look then
at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain bridge was
at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative pierre looked
at tsarevozaymishche but it happened that owing to a and then
at two oclock that night he sent for his secretary returning home
at ulm and had joined kutuzov at braunau now separated escaped capture
at us old fellows he laughing
at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him sorrowful and
at vera with guilty happy faces natasha looked
at vitebsk in four days march they may be at smolensk the french
at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her the fair
at what she was doing and then went up to her mother sonya glanced
at what was going on behind him from thirty years glance round
at what was happening before him as at a hunt he rostov gazed
at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new at dinner

attempt i cant prove it to you you say that abandoning the
attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these about the
attempting to break through and take the road kutuzov again without
attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then but all

bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little rubbing his
bald head over which she again looked at the letter embraced his
bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the drove to
bald hills remain at
bald hills retirement at
bald hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle life at
bald hills where one of russias oldest generals would defense of
bald hills while he himself needed no one and nothing he moscow to

ball and asked when he was leaving though enjoyed yesterdays
ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke round compact
ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked her improvised
ball another and a third flew over him falling in one cannon
ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous since the
ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the at that
ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he a cannon
ballet style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he somewhat in
balloons that were to destroy the french and despite all the of the

ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud to the
ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by crossing the
ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that in the

battery a second time made his way through a gully from raevskis
battery and gazed at what was going on around him with surrounding the
battery at which prince andrew had been when he examined reached the
battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you in our
battery led the french to suppose that here in the center of that
battery said the staff officer indicating the thats our
battery several men were lying about who had not been removed in the
battle
battle accepted that
battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolensk sought a
battle as though all were in a conspiracy of silence the the last
battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal lose the
battle but with his great tact and military experience field of
battle consisted in what orlovdenisovs cossacks had the whole
battle from right to left maintained their extended the forthcoming
battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and report the
battle heaven knows how and whence a stern note of which day of
battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to when any
battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after all of a
battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one at the
battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the before the
battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow after the
battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow became after the
battle of schon grabern than you do now said his son with before the
battle of the three emperors that is to say a slow the socalled
battle of the twentysixth of august took place the whole
battle on the march against an enemy three times as to accept
battle to bonaparte the council of war was just over when and give
battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have that the
battle where it is a question of life and death influence during a
battle would be the most terrible of all he had that tomorrows
battlefield
battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from from the
battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the over the
battles campaigns periods of war into such historic units
battles four times more men than the french army the the various
battles involuntarily pictured to himself the course of accounts of
battles the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed retreats after

be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty polish would not
be a bad woman he had often begun to make reflections she cannot
be a council of war at kutuzovs tonight though you there will
be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything and that would
be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to really would
be a manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed would not
be a matter of indifference whether we understand the seem to
be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature it would
be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a himself to
be a possibility of doing it and that possibility did not must also
be a series of victories and quite wrongly considered french to
be a single law governing the actions of men free will if there
be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself she must
be able to climb onto a horse should hardly
be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of army to
be able to equip him shall not
be able to find either your baggage or anything else now you wont
be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many order to
be able to submit from habit and she said i wish only to would only
be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten would not
be afraid
be agitated nicholas and his health would be the pretext wanted to
be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his remark would
be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon asked to
be altered without spoiling it voice could
be amusing as to
be an order about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the ought to
be and she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite wishes to
be and without solving this problem or at all before could
be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing began theyll
be another such chance to fall on a transport as therell hardly
be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding will there
be anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel bogdanich may
be appeased many other victims have perished and are perishing had to
be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your tomorrow youll
be arrested come you must own that this affair of the sergeant to
be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to stupid would
be ashamed of even that act finds justification in the taught to
be at his youthfulness and yet in the arrangement of everyone would
be at peace and immediately felt this not now
be at the head of a movement that had already become himself to
be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the service to
be began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper and girl might
be better to put a in bs place and b in ds or on the it would
be bound by what a false religion laid upon me i cannot
be but no me should still
be called in when you are wanted he said you will
be called wars they did not accord with the theory and could not
be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the should first
be carried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to not to
be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at asked to
be carried out we must part so find some place for it will
be chanced to
be completed had to
be completed the plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by must now
be concerned about the army each was thinking only of pretended to
be daylight soon said he yawning and went away it must
be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite can this
be decided and these conversations around him which were had to
be decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not fate would
be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me i shall
be descried the officers said that either napoleon horsemen could
be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has it would
be discerned irony could
be discharged she replied that she had never doubted his asking to
be discovered from the shevardino redoubt could not
be displeased at this excess of zeal would not
be done shes pretty i will do everything make your whats to
be done what can
be dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself seemed to
be either mary nikolievnas or the ivanovs that must
be essential for its purposes but in its jurisprudence and
be executed or not but this was only the external condition had to
be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one events may
be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to they cant
be farther away from the wounded man simply to
be fed and the sheep to be safe or they cannot wolves to
be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers they must
be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french alarm could
be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case it would
be fine gentlemen that would
be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was seemed to
be forgotten that in spite of everything she could times must
be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the should not
be freed from ineffectives such as dismounted cavalry of all
be friends and how happy they would be on natashas husbands would
be from their food said the sergeant major they used to it must
be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these every man
be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized mary to
be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems it would
be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon it would
be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who had to
be guiding ever since the enemys entry into smolensk he himself to
be had it was full of officers room to
be hanged the brigands ought to
be happy
be happy about thought he nothing to
be happy before natasha had finished singing would not
be happy if its in my power i shall
be he continued returning to the talk in the study always will
be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar its it may
be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in action could
be heard door could
be heard enough to
be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight forces could
be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now asleep could
be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which blows could
be helped it happens to everyone said the son with a it cant
be helped men must sometimes have masculine it cant
be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and it cant
be here
be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful countess will
be here let him
be his could never
be his old schoolroom and looking into natashas wildly used to
be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to i should
be if things were different it would
be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all would not
be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from one must
be inscribed on the charitable institutions thereby combining mere to
be issuing us new ones they say that when weve theyll soon
be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising my head
be just yet someday think what fun it will be when i it wont
be kept separate from the rest had long since been prisoners should
be late and the hunstmen had not yet reached their places when not to
be late count if i may venture to ask about ten but dont
be late for dinner but youll
be late we shall
be laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the they might
be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and reluctant to
be left behind and making a list of them as the countess had to
be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as him to
be made free and so simple that there would be no everything would
be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very hand again
be married secretly order to
be me thought rostov can it
be more napoleons man than ours and he is always advising said to
be my friend never speak to me of that of all that well wish to
be my only chance of seeing the emperor it wont be long now this may
be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and there would
be no doubt about it your highness there can
be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in there can
be no doubt of victory especially on this day when what is there must
be no more war old womens nonsense old womens there will
be nothing or mere content without form unlimited would
be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship will always
be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for not to
be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets division would
be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage she must
be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will it must
be ordained by divine providence he continued raising to it ever
be otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and could not
be over for me all these memories will be no more everything may
be poles all under the russian crown but here theyre seemed to
be possible for our order which has already in secret everything will
be possible she thought not daring to look at his face can it
be present were still hurrying to get dressed were to
be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski and had anxious to
be promptly terminated by peace ought to
be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that it and
be quick boris come here said natasha but well thenlets
be quick well all have breakfast together well then
be readily introduced into any theory can therefore
be regarded by the secular authorities matter would
be repulsed by hell and that he had seen a child hell must
be responsible for what might happen on the evening of could not
be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and pleased to
be rising does not come from the quarter they expect it rises feel to
be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he attack would
be rumpled fearing to
be said prince andrew go masha ill come well may
be said rostov it must have been someone else it cant
be saying nicholas to
be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors seemed to
be seen and in three places to left and right the grabern could
be seen and indefinite masses of troops ours and campfires could
be seen as the military scientists might convince nothing can
be seen pitchdark brother isnt there something to nothing could
be seen through the mist and here and there the roofs of church could
be sent for said he sternly gabions must
be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture wishing to
be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what were to
be she begged natasha to believe that she could not feelings might
be should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how it might
be so charming should give up bolkonski for that fool anatole used to
be so kind ill fix a time and go down to the estate just you will
be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but no why
be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of would again
be sure what change there was in his face all she could see could not
be surely it will all end in nothing it cant
be taken but the command of the armies became still more would then
be taken immediately to extinguish the fire to prevent measures to
be taken immediately to free his serfs and that till then steps would
be taken in his arms and michael ivanovich and let himself
be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his asked to
be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules can only
be taken to petersburg whatever i may be i cant live under me to
be tender he began speaking irritably of feminine meant to
be thanked yes the lord
be thanked yes theyve just finished supper let me have yes god
be the best way that would
be the collective will of the people transferred to their if power
be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak it cannot
be the exminister stein was there because his advice was him to
be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morning not to
be the last means of arousing him believed to
be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia march to
be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when was to
be time will just
be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she would not
be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of it would
be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the it may
be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet you will
be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her they should
be unable to stir and to await something unknown atmosphere to
be understood or approved by her husband would not
be understood without an explanation of the causal another cannot
be unjust and what is justice the princess never thought it all
be unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg as much as you is to
be unusual even more unusual than what he was seeing a everything to
be up to on the sly she meant that they would be they might
be useful and without any premeditation prince vasili man could
be very interesting said dessalles prince andrew is that must
be violent dont be afraid said pierre in answer to a i shant
be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov result must
be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times can one
be what is it to me i shall die she muttered let me
be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous they might
be with him thought he relishing his own goodness of well god
be with you sir may god preserve you apologetically christ

beautiful she is natasha without saying anything daughter how
beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed a tall
beauty a very queen said the nurse as she came to the what a
beauty and love which it was worth living for whatever realm of
beauty but the princess never saw the beautiful expression of that of
beauty exclaimed the count she looks better than oooo my
beauty forming a complete whole with her dress but all the her marble
beauty he observed in her at this time he was peculiar moral
beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no the moral
beauty she looked at natashas dresses and praised praising natashas

became animated the prince looked at her more and more as she
became aware that in front behind and on all sides the soldiers
became courtiers was clear to everyone it was this vicinity all
became disorganized many were drowned and many they again
became generally known and the dignity of france was that demand
became her husband natasha on the contrary had at once before he
became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas that it
became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination face she
became sad her face
became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two the shed
became silent

became silent the soldier who had been struck groaned and the men
became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside his helenes face
became thoughtful and frowned anna mikhaylovna saw prince vasili

became worse and worse the idea of putting nicholas position
because
because
because as far as i know that girl is not the stepmother secondly
because denisov so delighted in her singing she seriously mainly
because he did not understand her but simply loved her princess mary
because he did not want to but because it could not be guards not
because he had been an illegitimate son without a name young and
because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne and kind
because he knew by experience that if his patient did was dissatisfied
because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who anyone but
because he knows nothing does not want to know selfassured just
because he lacked the power to do so but because he understand not
because he loved her too well placing her far above everything of her
because he ordered it strange as these suppositions was done
because he was shaven but because they had never evidently not
because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a best way
because he wished to support his right hand with it carefully back
because her provinces have been pillaged they say the first place
because his voice shook when he said what they have proverbs and
because i alone have any influence with my father and am serving
because i have a detestation for all the french frenchified russian
because i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended me just
because i know what interests each of them and what to say said vera
because it had all been thought out and he knew all simple just
because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but right not
because it must be so and that it is a law inconceivable otherwise
because it was open to everyone always empty
because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this the east
because of everyone it must inevitably come about they alone but
because of his old age and experience of life the despised them
because of his own intellect feelings or knowledge he them not
because of its incongruities was exactly what was tarutino just
because of me so he confessed and it was all written down him suffer
because of napoleons orders but by their own volition borodino not
because of the depressing memories associated with hills partly
because of them or independently of them the broadsheets or
because of those tears quite forgave natashas joy mary who
because of you well thank god now lie down we can havent slept
because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed to blame
because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both brows but
because pierre pointed her out to him and because she chosen natasha
because she felt happy and was unable to control her amusing but
because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her was gay
because she had someone to adore her the adoration of also happy
because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and talked only
because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a but whether
because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in but just
because the boy standing below wants to eat it it or
because their eyes meeting said the rest not finish
because there were important reasons for so doing nodded acted thus
because they alone knew what their life meant to them believe it
because they friends from childhood had to think kindhearted and
because they fulfill the will of the people which has power only
because they were apprehensive as to how the difficulties only
because they would all receive handsome presents for the and also
because those who were deceived found pleasure in the salon or
because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our not only
because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those is all
because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to and also
because you can take everything along with you vodka and very wise

been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen must have
been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them now have
been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound would have
been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor near the rostov had
been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look rostov had

but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my by dogs
but i who moved you not he
but if i examine an act performed a month ago undoubtedly free
but if it is only some particular side of the evident nonsense
but if later god knows what will happen napoleon did will win
but im so sorry for him i dont know how im to say no mamma
but in anna pavlovnas presence no one dared to such inconvenience
but in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic is coming
but in princess drubetskayas case he felt after her his influence
but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed and dreaminess

but in the center where the men with a flag of truce left flanks
but in the crusades we already see an event occupying heroes will
but in the disposition it is said that after the be executed
but in the nations themselves what significance have historic leaders
but in the secret depths of her soul the question worth mentioning
but in their conversations were only discussing what be impossible
but instead of that he only excited himself more and more should act
but instead of that i have the honor to serve making arrangements
but instead of the band a choir began singing a voices again
but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i prince vasili
but it is difficult to win a campaign for that storming a fortress
but it then occurred to him for the first time that he go out
but it was immpossible to get rid of them pull it
but it was not much appreciated at napoleons alexanders court
but it was not really so it appears so to us because we the russians
but it was so terrible for him to think that anything his absence
but it was too late she was looking at them with an than usual
but it will depend on her i hope
but it would in fact have been difficult to give any such nonsense
but its historic results that time
but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable it then
but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that readiness within
but lay in the soul of every soldier and found merely understood
but learning from lavrushka that the transport infantry regiment
but mamma is he very much in love what do you think other hand
but meanness deceit envy intrigue and expect nothing
but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless an explanation
but more to the left and among the orangecolored uhlans had occupied

but not command the army and that the only way out of should reign
but not once of the impending danger doctors wife
but not taking his departure turning red
but notwithstanding this boris embraced him in a everybody did
but now alone by herself it was incomprehensible and simple
but now he felt disinclined to go to it domestic surroundings
but now that he has become a wretched comedian the was great
but now that the commander in chief addressed regimental commander
but now you yourself have begun i dont trust him havent spoken
but of angry resolve or gratitude
but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that the campaign
but oh god what am i to do if i love nothing but fame tell anyone
but on both sides of him other people with similarly everyone else
but on the afternoon of that day this emperors headquarters
but on the contrary were generally morally weaker moral qualities
but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect certainly improve
but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the advance if
but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day real war
but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again in said nothing
but only gives general orders concerning the movement action itself
but only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though female purchasers
but only the base the vile succeed i know who has sacrificed myself
but ordered the venerable old postmaster klyucharev to be to remain
but our allies dont like it at all invited here
but patience and time are wanted kamenski sent soldiers and attacking
but perhaps its not and this circassian with the madame schoss
but permit me to observe that i have the honor to protested balashev
but pfuel like a man heated in a fight who your excellency
but rather gave zest to his pleasures he spent the amusing himself
but rather thicker he and pierre were borne along those threads
but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after he had
but refrained from touching it pierre again covered window sill
but rostopchin did not look at him a vein in the young mans his eye
but satisfying his passions and would not advance from thought nothing
but see those two though not goodlooking are even about her
but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden was impossible
but since that its only been tormenting folk worth remembering
but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will an event
but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings the piece
but still tell him to come to the club it will all dear dear
but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of former years
but still with his fathers disapproval they excellent man
but strain his attention as he would he could not understand going on
but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued even voice
but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in about him
but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she different camps
but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as turn now
but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me that impression
but that is all the same it is not i but the hand of or dagger
but that is the effect of your visit he is not often good spirits
but that man has vanquished me he has taken hold emigrant count
but that most important agent by which nitrogen special plows
but that no shots were being fired from the battery something there
but that was not what made her unrecognizable she was and pale
but the author himself took the verses and began serious expression
but the battle will hardly be there his having raevskis knoll

but the process of the flight and disintegration of the and dukes
but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they to them
but the sums were either more or less than 666 once their numbers
but them saw nothing
but themselves natasha laughed at every word he interest anyone
but then they resumed their flight abandoning their sudden fright
but theories not worth an empty eggshell and havent in german heads
but there was nothing to come there was no joy in what next
but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha are now
but they also flattered him and he submitted to them astonished him
but they did not listen to me i told them his vasili interrupted
but they were only thoughts something was lacking him comforting
but they were useful necessary and indispensable small doses
but think it necessary to move about and talk in long conversation
but this affair of the war went on independently of were directing
but this is something special yes of course he did love more
but this one has hit and again he started trying to reach gone over
but those between virtue and vice beware of making any grand master
but though externally all remained as of old the sleeping castle
but thought it necessary on this occasion to address the senator
but through the village at one spot he stopped and open country
but to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow no reply
but to die he thought well if need be i shall do it nothing left
but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of russia and into maps
but to understand him is hard the mason began again he exists
but toss about till dawn because i think and cant help cant sleep
but treading with each step from the heel to the resounding parquet
but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly understand them
but unabashed
but under the influence of wine he said to himself it or read
but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty he rose to see man weary
but vera continued with a still more subtle smile to rise
but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the to ours
but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has defending us
but was kept all summer in moscow by his new duties the family
but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity impending battle

but we think the present delay is depriving the his majesty
but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that joyful emotion
but went limping up the hill round again
but what am i to do if i love her he thought and he the world
but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked not see
but what she does say is always clear and simple so says little
but what was good of him said anything
but whats his name well never mind there are not not kutuzov
but when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the of them
but when he had gone more than halfway he began to the squadron
but when he looked again with the naked eye he sometimes russians
but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of these things
but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went saying something
but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of in it
but where am i till now
but where are you off to not yet
but where is it he again wondered gazing at the prince andrew
but where is prince bolkonskis regiment can you point yes yes
but where to its one let them sing go away
but wherever it may turn there always will be the turns frequently
but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and left him
but which only wounded the selflove of both sides attain peace
but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest the fashion
but who to his chagrin got no title from me your majesty
but whom he would slap in the face before the emperor with pleasure
but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was what here
but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer whatever a bit
but with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she kiss it
but within the trinity gateway he was so pressed to menacing way
but within without us
but worse much worse than anybody else in the formerly imagined

by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to half rose

by a new conception and the logic of the situation has replacing them
by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them censer and
by a shell splinter had been carried into the kitchen thigh broken
by a stray cannon ball all this was possible in former be killed
by a suite galloped up to him staff followed
by activity expected the best results from the new man roused
by all talking at once and it was so strange that others expressed
by an act worthy of himself and of the french army he let these means
by an invisible smoker were blown
by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to charge shouted
by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal was seized
by anna pavlovna was about our diplomatic conversation guided
by another an unfamiliar voice from the dissatisfied interrupted
by another of the guests to each of them he made some one now
by antichrist and though julie now princess an invasion
by austerlitz and tilsit and erfurt him and
by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be killed and
by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired him spellbound
by bilibin who now in petersburg was quite at prevailed expressed
by bogdanovich

by examining my feelings toward him whom he may disquieting myself
by failures for failures resulting from deviations in even pleased
by fear not only of death but of sickness weakness suddenly overcome
by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man mother exhausted
by finding husbands for me most of whom i dont amused themselves
by force had they brought him there that force alone gave that only
by french cavalry and that though the attack had been been attacked
by fumbling and that blindfold yes our body is just adjust it
by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had emperor accompanied
by generals as any one of us sitting over a map in his study are made
by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes given him
by going to church every day for a week and not once ivanovna did
by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be that not
by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth they were
by he frowned trying to appear as if he did not want passed him
by her attitude her consciousness of the mikhaylovna indicated
by her husband and generalizing from that observation judging only
by her image when he listened to or himself took question but
by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one grief and
by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without was sitting
by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her still horrified
by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last evidently engrossed
by him as a pretext for quitting the army and accepted
by him but for fear of causing him to sin to leave of illusage
by him had now been ruined by somebody and that carefully prepared
by him who lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself taught us
by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther at all
by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind kutuzov accompanied
by his agility his particularly free manner of provincial society
by his boundless devotion to an idea besides involuntary respect
by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was and respected
by his correspondence with kurbski terrible and
by his energy and persistence had attained power intellect who
by his female relations was repugnant to him the other way to him
by his first movements and what are they doing all these so judging
by his notice and here too at the governors party been flattered
by his pillow without undressing every time she gave an armchair
by his presence kutuzov had received the order of st emperor honored
by his relations as a charming attractive and darling nikolenka
by his relations with bogdanich had paused on rostov absorbed
by his side excitement rode
by his strange comments but at this time he saw surprise people
by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vera berg judging
by his willingness and accuracy in work not surprised kutuzov
by intrigues violence exile and executions french too far
by its gray dress but no why did this thought never only veiled
by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that itself but
by its own momentum moved on
by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the cut off
by laughter stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he again crowned
by lauriston saying that there could be no formerly brought
by making any individual or any group of people of moscow
by making what amounted to a demand that pierre exploits concluded
by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him not done
by marriageable daughters and of the young ladies mammas burdened
by marya dmitrievnas advice count rostov took natasha to next day
by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable so that

by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouche which spot chosen
by not asking to remain attached to the sovereigns circles forever
by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for afraid that

by now late in the afternoon half the street was in it was
by official duties some by selfinterest house curiosity some
by on the right solemnly near
by other such excitedly animated and healthy men so are surrounded
by our officers and men at austerlitz one had saved a heroism shown
by passing close
by paul ivanovich kutuzov cantata composed
by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic the wall
by pierres rupture with his wife was the talk of duel confirmed
by prince andrew without display and without perceptible carried out
by providence for the gloomy role of napoleon predestined
by ramballes questions he also told what he had at first urged on
by real women gifted with a capacity to select and pleasure given
by reasoning but by something within him stronger convinced not
by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations ancients met
by renouncing society all who had known natasha before satisfied only
by right of seniority should be our chief so buxhowden who
by rostov happy passed
by sending someone else there first and the quiet little had made
by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in their rear
by she looked out the men servants were carrying the being carried
by six horses at a smart trot behind the caleche galloped and drawn
by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses they was met
by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the death and
by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should judge who
by some ten paces from prince andrew availing stood near
by spoiling his own career and he laughed at his father

by the road to the place to which he had been sent he had of riding

by the sausage eaters been occasioned
by the skill of the russian commanders here besides the law to moscow

by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake not occupied
by two hunt servants horse accompanied
by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not attempt and
by way of ryazan said natasha mary came
by what he had already done in that direction if he renouncing it
by what he had done was frightened
by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility and and excited
by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that officer and

campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet the crackling of
campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind our armys
can all be renounced which it
can at any moment consider the whole import of an event he never
can attain our three chief aims 1 selfknowledge for man that we
can be bought but think what being left behind means to things that
can be executed without some preceding order having been no command
can be more just more magnanimous than he and even everything who
can bestow it will render you my dear sir you are going to our order
can bweak napoleons line of communication that i
can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to used and
can convince me dear friend life and death are what that which
can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are than one
can do that later but the chief thing is the left well you
can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore inevitability alone
can fire when i like said pierre and at the word three so i
can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he medal he
can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the besides how
can i but how
can i do sonya cried natasha with a happy yet frightened do what
can i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you dear me
can it be that it is all over she thought can it marys letter
can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of all we
can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long how one
can never be known to anyone believe me he went on if of troops
can now turn our thoughts to the second bonaparte but vanquished we
can one admit that there is any connection between great stretch
can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of all i
can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable till you
can see that head i
can shift without him but its not nice to enter a family child and
can sonya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so and how
can supply you with everything even if you want to give contrary i
can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity and wife
can that be all over but natasha
can they be french he looked at the approaching his eyes
can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was every man
can well enjoy the evening now he is gone and no one will yes you

contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever on the
contrary but what dignity a princess he whispered to on the
contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that on the
contrary i will do what i can only i thought on the
contrary its very interesting replied pierre not quite on the
contrary just because he happened to be there he thought on the
contrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish express a
contrary replied the prince who had plainly become on the
contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well on the
contrary the army had never under the best material on the

contrary to his method of conducting war believe me he is is so
contrary to the restless confusion into which he thoughts quite
contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it on the
contrary what did it matter to him who then alone amid a quite the

could and continued their flight best they
could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a he never
could attack us he would have done so today said he if he
could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half best general
could be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk the artillery
could be heard from the hill there was no one now between the enemy
could be heard straggling hound
could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of diary there
could be seen from behind this came womens ragged curtains
could be seen the battlefield
could disclose it to me wished to
could do so before they
could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an how he
could find it out before others in the figure in which he how he
could finish an aidedecamp came in to summon prince andrew
could for their education and they have both turned out a father
could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and when he
could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work work and
could give her but until death came she had to go on only death
could happen they went away even before the battle of thing that
could have been applied word for word to himself in about natasha
could have been devised this combination of austrian present ones
could have been received in such a manner only because thinking he
could have happened what did i want i want his death but what
could have made so gross and palpable a blunder the hill
could have seen now would have surprised him he was nothing petya
could have spent so much time on such useless work that he
could i frankly mention my doubts to the brothers and to eloquent nor
could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he discussions that
could no longer restrain herself and wept while she princess mary
could no longer restrain himself and wept tender prince andrew
could not agree to as what he always wanted most was alterations he
could not and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft but he
could not be pictured and of whom he never thought divinity who
could not bear them that he
could not begin to speak instrument he
could not believe his eyes who are they why are they that he
could not believe that her fate was sealed especially skeptically he
could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in which he
could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence so he
could not cease to ask himself it was as if the thread of the and yet
could not conceive of life without the luxurious the countess
could not cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four and they
could not disregard oneself and ones own family so catastrophe one
could not do so away but
could not endure that sort of man he gave boris a prince andrew
could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might himself they
could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz tsarevich who
could not go back on his word and his father sighing and that he
could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully swollen lips
could not have a moments peace and could not die quietly said he
could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected beforehand he
could not have done it myself i should not have had the understand i
could not have explained how or why it was but prince andrew
could not have occurred the war
could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone live he
could not help being aware it just as we cannot renew an this he
could not help having his head turned by the homage he to dresden
could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit cavalrymans eye
could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was anyone but
could not help seeing these people took any notice of coachman who
could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how family she
could not imagine how he could speak to her now he petersburg he
could not in his heart at once agree with her that what about but
could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his but she
could not lie either on her face or on her side every made she
could not lift her head she was weeping princess mary
could not listen to this without wincing by patriotism kutuzov
could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn her skirt
could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling but she
could not possibly meet with any opposition order too
could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino that army
could not refrain from asking some more questions unnatural but
could not resist their desire to cut off and break up near vyazma
could not sacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice said he
could not save all the wounded and in the general thirty carts
could not say in how far mademoiselle bouriennes other maids
could not say with certainty whether the attack had been him and
could not scream like that came from the bedroom prince hers she
could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whom they
could not see what she ought to sacrifice or for whom she case she
could not stop short for the sake of one mans life good he
could not suppress as they passed out of the palace sigh he
could not tear myself away from them lord help me my wrong but
could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears old rostov
could not understand all that constitutes a mans dignity woman who
could not understand him all these people assumed because they
could not understand him ramballe refused food and soldiers who
could not understand how the man who put them there behind reason he
could not understand prince andrew
could not understand that there for the first involuntarily he
could not understand the boldness of her brothers princess mary
could not understand them however much she might think that she
could not withstand an attack knew there was only that knew they
could not write because she could not conceive the obligation she
could one say that in russian but how
could only have had it from the postmaster but evidently from he
could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia but
could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody that she
could see her again when she
could see nothing except the people about him pinched but
could see only one solution namely for nicholas to marry view she
could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard so he
could she have a love letter from him in her hand and how
could she see him but after she had been told that she serious and
could sit count peter

did actually play valses and the ecossaise and catherine petrovna
did all in his power he caused the words maison de ma napoleon also
did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought if they
did as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed as he
did everything so simply and with such assurance then he
did he grasp its meaning for a moment green shade
did he say to you what are those verses read them what else
did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans what what
did he see an advanced post of the russian army but while exist nor
did her hair her illchosen words and her jealousy dressed and
did his contempories carried away by their passions not only
did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but not only
did his utmost to gain his new masters favor but merely
did i say said alpatych coming into his own again there what
did in december namely a hundredth part of the original it actually
did indeed she laughed he is so well received andrew i
did indicated his unusual position but dolokhov who in everything he
did it all money i
did it because he
did it begin when did it all come about and here he was her how
did it gently said the boy aunt i
did it happen daddy he said when and in what merchant where
did klyucharev do wrong count asked pierre but what
did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka although iogel
did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing which she
did not always keep up with the troops they the commissariat
did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart it he
did not answer about she
did not answer she did not understand who was to go princess mary
did not appear impossible to her it was at those words happiness
did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up prince i
did not assume the title of commander in chief but the emperor
did not at all know when you and i had said such michael ivanovich
did not at first recognize the place from which he had povarskoy he
did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife if he
did not believe her ears denisov had proposed to the countess
did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt intellect he
did not come either and natasha not knowing that same pierre
did not concern himself with the interests of his own class liked he
did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on old woman
did not consider kurakins demand for his emperor alexander
did not consider that this suited them since death by quite rightly
did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree people he
did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army but they
did not dare absent himself for any length of time except whim and
did not doubt that for an instant why should he not love her him he
did not even wish to know of his existence but would who formerly
did not exist regimental commander
did not expect herself evidently
did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket he himself
did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrew well i
did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense activity tushin
did not fall down or faint she was already pale but the princess
did not finish for on the still air he had sidorych simon
did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the count kochubey
did not finish leave my room she exclaimed and weakness she
did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the conversation
did not go away he untied the handkerchief around but dolokhov
did not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined for them
did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the instinct and
did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken the smoke
did not have the desired effect the genuine as even philanthropy
did not improve or alter the position of the troops and backward
did not in the least understand but to which she which she
did not keep to send for a friend now some expensive which they
did not know but was it really not possible for kutuzov to right he
did not know german began questioning him in paulucci who
did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come men she
did not know how to develop existed within him his meeting which he
did not know nicholas my darling and i
did not know was that the place where they presented him what pierre
did not know where they were and were very anxious and countess
did not know whether she liked it or not she even solitude she
did not know why he felt a pang the day was so suddenly he
did not know you i should think you did not want what you if i
did not leave the battery he decided to have the guns order and
did not let him finish mavra kuzminichna
did not let him go when he released him prince andrew saw some time
did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all but napoleon
did not like that tone and said it was stupid and hayfork others
did not listen him and
did not listen to him but rostov
did not listen to the end but continuing her train of princess mary
did not make that effort because they were not the russians
did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess that he
did not meet with success either the theaters set up in troops these
did not move and for a long time said nothing after this the mason
did not much interest him because at that moment regenerating himself
did not need anything of that kind he neither saw nor ended he
did not notice that in regard to his army he was exactly napoleon
did not notice that she called his sister mary and prince andrew
did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted he alone
did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it and it
did not once mount a horse to inspect his weeks and
did not purposely say things to please her but whatever natasha he
did not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling head and
did not receive this new russian person very zhilinski evidently
did not regain consciousness till late in the day when station he
did not remember what she had said and that she had no that she
did not reply and went out of the room but pierre
did not reply but looked at her seriously things she
did not reply but rostov
did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she happened natasha
did not reply the carriage and horses had long prince andrew
did not reply the hussar
did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the the princess
did not reply though with the quickness of memory prince vasili
did not return to her the whole evening duty and
did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and murat he
did not say it was quite impossible but suggested the steward
did not see hear or understand anything clearly only occupation he
did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the prince andrew
did not see it those who
did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were prince andrew
did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the though he
did not seek out the best position but on the the russians
did not show it that moscow would certainly be abandoned though they
did not sleep said princess mary shaking her head no i
did not stir an adjutant dismounting lifted the unconcerned and
did not stop at any one of these positions because borodino they
did not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has once was
did not take his eyes from him but braced himself up more hut petya
did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed the bridge
did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him or blame they
did not think it proper to write and challenge prince andrew
did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but and nicholas
did not to confess that he
did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad that she
did not turn up they became convinced that moscow rostopchin who
did not understand agitated her she said nothing but which she
did not understand but which was working well action he
did not understand in horror at her own vileness simply when she
did not understand made natashas breast heave and a she herself
did not understand them and she always dreaded being a though she
did not understand them she positively
did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was princess mary
did not understand what was said to them in french the hussars
did not upset the regular routine of life in the this expectation
did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and father i
did not wish to court societys favor now he alone was how and
did not wish to look and again turned away but again again pierre
did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to that he
did not yet sing well as all the connoisseurs who heard her but she
did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he battles he
did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the only now
did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he not only
did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the the action
did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to as natasha
did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready still less
did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon question why
did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment his regiment
did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater longer they
did still harder work on their own land he did not know land they
did that deed and i put the knife under your head while you he says
did that end and when did this new terrible state of things was when
did that genius napoleon know it for no one issued any still less
did that old man alone in opposition to the general but how
did the honors to the prince moscow hospitality
did the russians not fortify the position on the field of not only
did their business with strained smartness they gave loaded and
did these things not under any external impulse as people liver she
did they arrest you dear lad at your house and how
did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were but why
did we talk about at dinner tikhon what
did you disappear to inquired denisov well where
did you enter the service he asked with that what year
did you get this she asked from whom
did you hear but what
did you say asked pierre what what
did you say go on go on no what
did you want cried marya dmitrievna growing angry but what
didnt finish carting the dead away and as for the and still
didnt i tell you michael mitrich that if it was there now
didnt recognize you he said but rostov was otherwise why i
didnt see it but you
didnt see that everybody is packing up and you
didnt think of it i never promised because i i
didnt you capture him so dont be surprised if not only still why
didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have and why
didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i and why
didnt you tell me dronushka isnt it possible to help but why
didnt you warn me said the princess with mild andrew why
didst thou and why did the whole world incomprehensible being
die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind reflections better
die and all will end youll die and know all or cease was youll
die away in the distance the other pack rushed by the wood began to
die fo him added the orator with animation well all

die i love life i love this grass this earth this air wish to
die in defense of the hive there is no longer the measured ready to
die like a dog said he must one
die there is no other way for me the letter began then he or to
die to die for him thought rostov oh to
die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but they may
died and i did not know he was alive how sorry i am that he yes he
died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death before he
diese russen muttered a german zum henker

different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of bridge from
different sides the old prince did not evince the least french from

dignity which thou hast lost the ancient

diminished but only changed character the horses were however not
diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people it cost of

dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had prince andrew

evening at speranskis with only a few friends as the dine that
evening at the melyukovs the girls went to their spent the

event appeared as merely due to the will of certain crusades that
event had that event not occurred these hints would have with the
event have been executed we forget about the others that with that
event in the english club where all who were strange an
event in the family of the old rostovs count ilya rostov last happy
event is taking place people express their opinions and when an
event joyful or sad that took place in that house others every
event not in the power of one man but in the interaction of of the
event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose whenever an
event of an
event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree will the
event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france and the
eventempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this she was
events and are executed series of
events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if all these
events and such histories as thiers will be heroes produces
events assumed their true historical character when but when
events depended on those commands but examining the events that the
events had immense consequences for him and for all other trifling
events mingled with dreams and again someone he or again real
events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and their narration
events power produces
events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most shaping of
events the more reassured he was that everything would be course of
ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation depressing than
ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole no command
ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden who hardly
ever deeper and deeper when water is spilled on dry ground the army
ever fresh as
ever had she had
ever happen to you said natasha to her brother when does it
ever have thought could we
ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he his heart
ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than an insurrection
ever since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who the country
ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with bennigsen who
ever since we parted why are we not together as we were last my heart
ever so much in love with you and hes very nice very was anybody
ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening hurrah growing
ever the soldiers handed up the charges turned scrupulously than
ever when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came same as
everincreasing crowds were running back to where confused and
everrecurring sounds distinguishing the whistle of flying to the
every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement ourselves that
every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to themselves of
every day especially the foreigners who did so with unexpected ideas
every detail he entered through the gates with their stone same in
every direction i see that i raised it in the direction in arm in
every eventuality every possibility even to the foresight for
every eye she met now was immediately dropped found that
every face and only kutuzovs angry grunts and occasional frown on
every face bore almost the same smile expressing unseemly young ones
every footstep in that house since the terrible news had and even
every freemason should cultivate in himself these temple which
every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did felt that
every large household there were at bald hills several as in
every letter
every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are outraging me
every moment to meet the monarch and conscious thought expecting
every night before lying down he said lord lay sickness meant
every question concerning his property when one person regard to
every rejoinder everything was assumed to be possible noticeable in
every respect though five years before and one year later showing him
every russian
every russian but why are you so anxious you have still times for
every side or the projectiles that flew over him whistling from
every slightest tone of which was familiar to his even breathing
every soldier there were unconsciously bent on avoiding the as of
every step pulled himself up slightly arching his back it was and at
every turn
every year the only resource obviously inevitably increased
every young man who came to the house seeing those charming girls
everybody always has liked me and i am so willing to do she thought
everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of beloved by
everybody and who considered himself above them was all disdainful of
everybody attached to the court was packing up and the in brunn
everybody began speaking clearly and definitely reappeared and
everybody feel confused denisov blushed too but smiled escapade made
everybody good day
everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure and indeed
everybody looked at him understanding what he and unexpectedly
everybody now

eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it her beautiful
eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave and closing his
eyes he said in a low voice raising his
eyes his eyes kept closing and in his fancy appeared now his own
eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed pierre with her
eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seams raising his
eyes looking at her bare arms and neck suddenly hundreds of
eyes lowered his

eyes turned to look at a general with a suite napoleon berthiers
eyes upon it told her to read the letter aloud when she fixing his
eyes went with unusually hurried steps down the with frightened
eyes were raised to the count and all
eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen purple his
eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when prince andrews
eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she with shining
eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls hand covered his
eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching bound pierres

for certain how much vera would have and did not receive at not know
for coming my dear thank you
for counsel a motherinlaw for welcome but theres none a wife
for departure of the prince the princess his son and the to arrange
for discerning the higher laws such men
for doing he imagined all sorts of possible younger generals
for everybody that the seas should be common to all navigable rivers
for everyone to go armed to the three hills tomorrow and been given
for fear princess mary should ask her father to give his done so
for fighting advantageous conditions
for fighting for drinking
for finding fault with her no grounds
for food the man said an officer had once given him a needs money
for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was possible only
for guidance help in regeneration said pierre i hope
for half its value and half the debts still remained by auction
for harvesting
for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on refutes himself
for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for the rank
for he rose and went up to boris sitting here
for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy one however
for heavens sake relieve me of something said the do please
for her formerly i very much wanted nicholas to dreadfully sorry
for her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and them and
for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room she rang
for her she was not vexed with these people was hard
for her she went silently toward the door that everyone and wait
for her then it occurred to her that her aunt and the had done
for her to give full play to her feeling for her more possible
for herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough complete costume
for herself and for philip the footman who had begged fathers pardon
for him
for him and affection
for him and how do you get on with that german well send
for him as a man but what can one do am sorry
for him at first pierre wished to take another seat so as make way
for him dear sonya whom he loved and thought of just the to kiss
for him he looked at natasha as she sang and thought impossible
for him in store
for him it would be good for him to have dreadfully afraid
for him similar to that which he had once felt passionate admiration
for him that he escaped me but ill find him she said its lucky
for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt little meaning
for him the general good will this was his which gained
for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents was time
for him to do themselves turned to the right and reasonable thing
for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to pavlovna waited
for him to vent his wrath on trembling and sufficient importance
for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to intelligent men
for his fellow men for himself and for his own and loving tears
for his friendship to her fedya often talked to him about of rostov
for his future were completely altered he was not rich his plans
for his great exploits there are all told us by his grandeur
for his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant prince andrew
for his peace of mind that pale sad refined face was desirable
for his rapidity of perception and decision might call
for his return he was given four weeks leave of definite date
for his sake she cried its splendid sacrificed everything
for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being a martyrs death
for his sovereign rose again in rostovs soul in all its and love

for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or or harmful
for it nothing good on pierres part seemed to her to be an to him
for it shouted berg who was now assistant to the will answer
for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went without waiting
for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov the preparations
for jurisprudence
for kuragin were sitting at tea in dolokhovs unbounded affection
for leave in order to see natasha before she was married not apply
for liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one of france
for life
for living people if you liked him too it would be a good words had
for living that is all a machine
for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate sacrifice himself
for love plain and awkward theyll take her for her marry marie
for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles grief
for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with refusing it
for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the first time

for not having lunch when one can get it no reason
for nothing and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and hoped
for nothing he had no thought of betraying us he tried losses went
for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said for you
for on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he thank him
for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others is impossible
for only one days ration of bread remains and in some of prussia
for orders about their departure this was before his talk was asking
for partisan warfare at night he would go out for and aptitude
for peace a secret peace concluded separately and projects
for permission to serve in the army person but

had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of the prince
had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been oldenburg and
had all been brought for the night to a large house on the when they
had all been given and were now being executed the orders
had all the letters in his hand opening them he still
had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight affair he
had almost been jealous on his wifes account was the admit he
had already achieved great success in the service was drubetskoy who
had already been approved as soon as prince andrew that weyrothers
had already been done feet hands necks everything essential
had already been sent for village and
had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat dolokhov who
had already entered prussia and our second war with our troops
had already heard from his wife in the presence of prince andrew
had already managed to speak to lise about the match anna pavlovna
had already occupied near kaluga position he
had already passed through the terrible and deafening roar which he
had already sealed the order the count looked around officers face
had already taken definite shape in his imagination that the boyars
had always had a poor opinion of prince vasilis old bolkonski
had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on prince nicholas
had and increased the number by all possible means he the peasants
had any reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with for hay
had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man and so formerly he
had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready carts which
had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see prince andrew
had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg decisive moment
had ascended the hill and reached the little village street when he
had asked permission to be present at the battle out of accountant who
had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted affair he
had at a low price the tone of the proclamation was not as could be
had at last been realized in the clear morning seemed unattainable
had attacked the battery and seeing kutuzov were firing the french
had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its the french
had become a habit schemes and devices for which he getting on
had become a little quieter he explained to rostov that when he
had become more intimate when prince andrew was in petersburg but
had been a remarkable crop that year had been commandeered said there
had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets villages what
had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long the shawl
had been and his health was poor the old man laid special as he
had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the when they
had been announced in a manifesto and about the war that
had been arranged and the preparations made by rostovas abduction
had been arrested with pierre all right you can tell soldier who
had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to his side
had been brought that day broadsheets that
had been but helenes imperturbable conviction that it younger man
had been chosen criticizing not the position itself position that
had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her little princess
had been detected by them from above
had been disabled but the artillerymen were still as guns crews
had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to moscow she
had been disputing with denisov what should be done while dolokhov
had been dragged out of the houses besides russian goods that
had been dug and from which a few guns were firing was small trenches
had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day him he
had been entrusted the more he realized the absence of all whom it
had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and petersburg and
had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk thoughts that
had been forgotten and only at the very end of tushins battery
had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the bed that
had been growing more and more agitated as he listened pierre who
had been in august all was destroyed except something moscow it
had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different than it
had been in told as by an old soldier he did not campaigns he
had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing tushins guns
had been killed he tried not to change his former way of his son

had begun looking after him he had always experienced since she
had begun on the right flank and the french were already the action
had begun the attack next morning no one would have redoubt but
had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly the fog
had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss did leave her she herself
had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it since he
had behaved better during those awful moments the father know which
had borne the first period of separation from her natasha who
had broken faith with him which he felt the more his betrothed
had brought a letter from his wife the countess helene frenchman who
had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in present he
had brought from there these connections with the emperors and
had brought him papers konovnitsyn
had brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without kutuzov who
had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against they all

had called his comite de salut public were taking shape and in jest
had captured the fleches and the village of semenovsk the french
had changed poured water over his head and scented when he
had chased
had chosen the position warmly displayed his russian bennigsen who
had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre stood a crowd
had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in letters that
had come from the east to the west slaying their fellows of men
had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at natasha who
had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his where she
had come into the hollow and were firing at our men infantry who
had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there denisov who
had come out from moscow joined them this rostopchin who
had come out of the study into the dancing room with denisov who
had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of all which he
had come over her since the ball she was silent and change that
had come over them you are as like him as two peas cloud that
had come straight from the bath papa used to if he
had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been boris who
had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to prince vasili
had come upon them and in every face the fire the stormcloud
had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they wore and those who
had completed the tour of the garden which brought her when she
had completely forgotten denisov not wishing anyone rostov who
had composed and to which he was trying to fit music which he
had composed for anatole and as she read it she which dolokhov
had cost millions and had done nothing except that fifty years
had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few when they
had decided to play until that score reached fortythree him he
had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight the if it
had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which goodnatured man
had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told the count
had died away the french heard a strange sound stonebuilt kremlin
had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris countess bezukhova
had disappeared princess carriage
had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff though kutuzov
had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with when he
had done on their first meeting at kochubeys speranski as he
had done seven years before at austerlitz as he
had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength firing which
had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he when morel
had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz two months
had emptied the samovar rostov took a pack of cards and when they
had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox when balashev
had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it which she
had entered silently how hes grinning the fat mug kuzminichna who
had entered the hall after him they had met at the last doctor who
had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a that society
had european life politics freemasonry philosophy and and such
had ever inflicted on her trying to convict her he told injustice he
had evidently been drinking soldiers who
had evidently had no evil intent though he might adjutant also
had evidently pleased him and latterly he had marry bourienne
had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to that day
had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a as she
had experienced this before but never so strongly as destroyed he
had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went world he
had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke the wind
had fallen asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister crying she
had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously bezukhova she
had feared the end he had twice experienced that formerly he
had felt in the impending reforms he was going to prince andrew
had felt that he regarded her with indifference and formerly she
had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a when telyanin
had finished she turned to him with her usual smile as he
had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak before she
had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over when he
had first entered the room the smile of a perfectly which she
had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece breakersup who
had five little ones while i you see only left a younger brother
had fixed on that number because fortythree was the thousand he
had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its residents who
had followed him like an eagle three steps at a time the son
had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of what konovnitsyn
had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and whom everyone
had forgotten her age and by force of habit apparently she
had forgotten his sons letter on the drawingroom table her father
had forgotten i really must go home business yes i
had forgotten she was dead and tikhon reminded him that she alive he
had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he young nicholas
had formed in france unites into one group with the people that
had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and bezukhova who
had found himself unable any longer to restrain dispatched kutuzov
had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look room but
had gained the confidence of his superiors by his the campaign
had given a neighbor three families of house serfs so before he
had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose the french
had given orders that news should be brought to him of assented and
had given to all who asked as long as he had anything surmises and
had given to his words i heard of it in orel and you princess mary
had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but no one
had given up to him corner boris
had given when questioned had come back to him in his answers he
had gone a command rang out to the uhlans after ostermann
had gone a dressmaker from madame suppertroguet waited after she
had gone a little less than a mile five more riders when they
had gone and the members of the household met when pierre
had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with when they
had gone in before him and began waking somebody the orderly
had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column when he
had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders prince andrew
had gone out to admonish them but was told it was horses alpatych
had gone prince theodore
had gone things in the rostov household were more after nicholas
had gone to see his father could not explain his prince andrew
had gone with others to the cathedral whence they were her husband
had got up and gone to the next one which was campfire pierre
had great success and was honored was by the special that helene
had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him that he
had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the halted it
had grown so dense that though it was growing light they the fog
had grown thinner and paler during the last few days vasili who
had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are thought he
had had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration feeling she
had had time to consider and determine the distance of before rostov
had had when lying there it was unsatisfactory thoughts he
had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be reached braunau
had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news at what
had happened and expressed their readiness to punish asking what
had happened and to which she could find no answer her what
had happened during those last days and during the first of what
had happened or what she felt everything seemed dark understand what
had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince over what
had happened to her but was unable either to realize what
had happened to her she was regarded in that light and had the kind
had happened was that news which afterwards proved to present what
had happened what had happened nothing he had merely of what
had he for any more glory the one thing he wished for what need
had he got rid of his hat before he ran into partisans hardly
had he not known that it was costing him a thousand daughters illness
had he repented of his unbelief was he now there there he believe
had he retained power alexander i having fulfilled his mankind happy
had heard about you from my page drubetskoy have you heard smile i
had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that joke he
had held at this time of his madness and they always proved views he
had him enrolled among the cossacks expeditions and
had himself composed which he
had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence his sister
had insisted on princess marys leaving at once as it was the marshal
had intended carefully wrote twentyone thousand he
had intentions concerning herself and rostov their governors wife
had joined obolenskis regiment of cossacks and left for after petya
had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending dimmler who
had just arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost toll who
had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought rostov who
had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he and he
had just prepared a card by bending the corner of thousand rostov
had just returned from captivity and by an hussar lavrushka who
had just returned from there as a special messenger he prussia and
had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the details she
had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with frenchmen who
had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation the emperor
had killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five standard another
had kissed each other but today they felt it could meeting they
had known ever since she could remember and had always seen face she
had known from a child with this new conception of her whom he
had known from childhood and who had now become a wealthy the rostovs
had known previously but the one that had sung as twas voice natasha
had known that you wished it the entertainment would if they
had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white when he
had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome sportsman he
had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he because he
had left all the others let him go and he ran to her since he
had left his nephew irritably pushed up an nicholas who
had left kutuzov dolokhov came up to him and took his when pierre
had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter as he
had left the room we have heard of your prowess but short man
had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles wifes command
had listened at the door in a suffering and weary voice he that night
had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and till then
had long been expected for supper climbed carefully malasha who
had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby natasha who
had long since promised to hand over to him some papers widow who
had long since put aside her book she sat silent her princess mary
had looked it from the hill the officer had pointed out when they
had lost all dignity and at the twitching cheeks of princess which
had lost more than half his men he said the attack had repulsed he
had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his his father
had made an agreeable impression on him when he had princess mary
had made desperate efforts to combat it since the depression and
had made in his campaigns and even in politics his son him bonaparte
had made the house stuffy people really
had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip the guards
had maintained with heat that peace was impossible road rostov
had married an old man and that there was a suitor kitty odyntsova
had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the which he
had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take once she
had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he when he
had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich have happened
had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled colonel who
had never been censured should not be held to blame service who
had never felt till that moment she ran out sobbing thought she
had no boots was so simple while what they proposed was so the men
had no chance of being present at the review he held at but rostov
had no connection with the previous conversation for a few story that
had no connection with what he was saying flitted thoughts that
had no connections in the city and was a stranger there in that he
had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i us i
had no idea exclaimed princess mary ah andrew i and i
had no idea never guessed at all there we
had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only regarded it
had no time he was afraid of falling behind the colonel he
had no time to answer the servants came out to meet prince andrew
had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about again he
had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression but he
had no understanding at all of the people he supposed circles and
had not at all expected such a sight just before him around he
had not been burned the kremlin which was not churches that
had not been foreseen and was not fortified by position which
had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and his efforts
had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted rostov who
had not entered her mind for years thoughts of a life thoughts that
had not happened to him he could not tell them simply cavalry attacks
had not known that he was dying how could he have failed to if he
had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever bilibin who
had not merely one or two in his head but dozens some only plans he
had not merely reached hard winter condition but sportsman rostov
had not recognized rostov and had not and absentmindedness
had not returned a tongue
had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should before it
had not seen battleground he
had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov private and
had not seen her with prince andrew it always seemed to him as he
had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had timokhin who
had not the five rubles that would make him happy poor man
had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed but he
had not yet been presented to the emperor when this letter
had not yet got out of moscow and reached the beauharnais train
had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental plain appearance
had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had elated he
had noticed at their first halting place after leaving that pierre
had noticed her in the theater and said of her napoleon himself
had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look him she
had now almost vanished but at the same time pierres confusion
had now as if purposely sent his men to the very rostovs and
had now become unpleasant to her and for various reasons quite frank
had now handed it all completely over to his sons establishment but
had obtained through an acquaintance and sent mikhaylovnas advice
had occurred between them whatever her fathers misunderstanding that
had often before during the last six weeks remained sitting he
had on a new and favorite pair of shoes and listening to the toe she
had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully morning but
had once been must now be different he told me once everything that
had once prized so highly were still more so not only independence he
had only acquired by imitating other parents prince vasili
had only considered the possibilities of success but now battles he
had only that morning returned to town from his count rostopchin
had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and always he
had opened the clavichord and was strumming on grandfather mishka
had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than whether he
had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when youth weve
had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the when he
had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and four weeks
had passed since prince andrew found himself in the seven days
had passed straight through the glass porch between the be announced
had passed the stormtossed sea of european history had seven years
had passed were stronger and that the position at positions they
had peacefully driven their twohorse carts loaded with blue jackets
had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked but scarcely
had pounced on someone meanwhile
had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make difficulty that
had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he campaign he
had probably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was the cart
had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the hand he
had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of these she
had promised to take home whom he
had purloined it from princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne
had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting the frenchman
had put but which was always in her mind and how much no one
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she parties she
had quite lost his head and that it was probable that he had there he
had reached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of before they
had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old alpatych who
had reached the embankments that were being thrown up before he
had reached the other side of the house and its slanting the sun
had reached the village and seated himself in meanwhile kutuzov
had reached their destination halted piled arms and supposing they
had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether when he
had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the which he
had really been there the night before and really seen whether he
had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and dolokhov who
had received
had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to rostovs he
had received from paris and advised natasha to have one which she
had recently joined the regiment was now in the same sixteen who
had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he which he
had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a time he
had remained intact between the russian and french forces house which
had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had as shinshin
had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and when he
had resumed correspondence with her wrote patriotic drubetskaya who
had retained the conception of the ancients it would have if history
had returned as everybody told him a fine young man boy he
had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts on that wheat and
had returned voices were heard outside the shed whos after he
had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and where he
had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage someone who
had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight the sun
had risen that he
had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for spacious and
had said it and they all felt awkward why she
had said she was charmante because he
had said soandso and this minister soandso seemed the emperor
had said was clever and to the point what the general that denisov
had sat down beside him a third was playing a viennese officer who
had saved rostov took the joke as an insult flared up and girl he
had seated himself beside the countess listened with dimmler who
had seemed no escape she wrote that the last which there
had seen
had seen anna semenovna if he
had seen at bald hills when he passed through it what he
had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse fancied he
had seen her guests out when she
had seen him before where he
had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or whom pierre
had seen what she
had sent greetings and still thought of them and other mary alexeevna
had served up was received with pleasure by all her novelty she
had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river a thaw
had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in the sun
had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some denisov who
had she been like this when he entered the day before quite different
had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of but never
had since filled that post irreproachably for bogucharovo and
had smilingly expressed disapproval of dolokhovs living at how helene
had so amazed nicholas of which
had so despised seven years before gentlemeninwaiting he
had so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the which he
had so long waited presents itself to him at last he firmly which he
had so often that day senselessly repeated that word pierre who
had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to proposals which
had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not the general
had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre whether he
had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak has long
had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and natasha he
had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had letter but
had spent in the country years they
had spent two years continuously in the country prince andrew
had splashed mud over some foot soldiers prancing horse
had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and words he
had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on drubetskaya who
had spread by the fact that the emperors carriage had rumor that
had spread out their linen said one of the men gazing the women
had started before any of the others behind along the corps which
had started so late on the first of september the road moscow they
had started the colonel and some of his men got across and which they
had stealthily procured after swallowing a little she had arsenic she
had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from the rain
had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more twenty she
had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris an aidedecamp
had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused man who
had such a splendid boy so full of life to die nothing why
had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness that he
had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she
had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to opposing armies
had supper fed the horses and came out into the their masters
had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim when it
had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the shop she
had taken from his sister and another ten thousand rubles he
had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt when she
had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized change that
had taken place in pierre they considered that he had change that
had taken refuge here from the fire with their families who
had talked a great deal grew excited when he previously he
had tea served in the small drawing room said catiche has
had that day been transferred his headquarters
had that day originated among the higher french opinion which
had the air of a man happily performing one of the shoulders he
had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations there pierre
had the next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his man who
had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the she knew
had the power he began again i would not take prisoners if i
had the princess looked at natashas face before she but hardly
had the right to fire when they liked as they approached mist they
had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the love stories
had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern the captain
had then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and man she
had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink that she
had there seen the same pettiness worldliness and and he
had thought and thought again now now he will never princess mary
had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he as he
had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket when she
had till then constituted an army flowed all over the men who
had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of he had
had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the the french
had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on before shinshin
had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took but they
had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so all this
had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to his health
had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their what he
had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him that he
had to endure and love and that she did people she
had to give in and stop while carriages passed in determination he
had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg and it
had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be yet he
had to retire of their own accord for they had no water would have
had to say took the papers from him without a word the officer
had to see the marshal of the nobility for the prince andrew
had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty sonya but
had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the which he
had to take cried he village youve
had to talk over a very important matter with him i fathers i
had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so what she
had told his wife all that had passed between himself that nicholas
had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied if you
had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of what he
had too much of something and that because of this she that natasha
had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took monstrous that
had trusted worthless and insignificant people but the sovereign who
had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son wife who
had two passions and consequently two joys her princess mary
had understood that this woman might belong to him looking he
had up for a second examination were the hardest of prisoners were
had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with whom he
had very important results for him it seemed to frankness which
had very little aptitude or inclination practical business which he
had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life his father

had weakened and a patriotic and antifrench alexanders regime

happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one events to
happen many wealthy families who usually left town for something to
happen only not that anything might
happen said rostov as may
happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he what would

happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all extraordinary may
happen what can
happen what may we shall win battle tomorrow
happened
happened asked nicholas what has

happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to what had
happened he asked himself i have killed her lover what has
happened he saw the frightened and then infuriated face would have
happened how it
happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had would have
happened she asked i am so terrified has anything
happened so all these causes myriads of causes coincided could have
happened so chance created the situation genius because it
happened the evening before yes yes all that has that had

happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face what was
happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the quite lately
happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant what is
happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was as often
happens in early youth especially to one who leads a as often
happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should as always
happens pierre did not feel the full effects of the as generally
happens was met by representatives of the other the as always
happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion as often
happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before as often
happens when traveling princess mary thought only of as always
happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of as always
happier for it so thought prince bolkonski while even the
happier with her than with some dolllike julie i can certainly be
happily and suddenly he remembered how his love had strongly and
happiness
happiness consists in striving to attain them we must mans highest
happiness floated continually in her imagination like of family
happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even with a
happiness her own
happiness here on earth toiling suffering struggling enjoyment and
happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and for positive
happiness it would be to die not in saving the emperors life of what
happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not but this
happiness that happiness is within him in the created for
happiness this oak seemed to say are you not spring love
happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to health and
happy
happy and agitated but at once remembered that this natasha felt
happy day came and on that memorable sunday when but the
happy expression the same man who had rushed out of the stupid and
happy eyes at her sisterinlaw bright and
happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted officer with
happy faces announcing the trophies taken the congratulations and
happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband and how
happy in these novel surroundings that she only lighthearted and
happy laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a been so
happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their with a
happy natasha motionless on her knees she was unable to but quietly
happy princess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time his son
happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of the same
happy resolution you see on the face of a man who concentrated and
happy smile occasionally he rose and walked about an unconsciously
happy than before tranquil and
happy to be acquainted with her he did not wish to consider himself
happy weariness of life overcame him with its former had been
happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the animated and
happy young face he experienced a feeling tenderness his handsome
harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which i caught myself
harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened caught himself
hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm to live
hard it was for her son kept demanding now a carriage realize how
hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not find it
harder
harder his position became and the more terrible the himself the
hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the glance and
hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled head they had
hardly exchanged a couple of words with him pierre pierres sake
hardly feasible interesting but
hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give talking they
hardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears thought she
hardly had he uttered the word poltava before reply but
hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar nesvitski could
hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a they had
hardships and dangers themselves to
hare
hare and not without agitation he looked round and sighted the
hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and like a
hare toward the
hare would cross the field now id show you what sort a fullgrown
harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling with what does
harm was scarcely perceptible as they were given in harmful the
harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself more in
harmony with the spirit of the times undertake the principles in

having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability with another
having anything to do with the domestic serfs the he disliked
having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and and boris
having asked to see princess mary told her that alpatych dessalles
having become an emperor he again went out to kill obeyed him
having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with next day
having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position when ermolov
having been sent with papers from kutuzov to the man wanted
having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold angrier at
having brought the drama to a close and stripped the the manager
having brought the workbag joined the circle prince hippolyte
having deduced the refutation he needed would again thought and
having done all i can for denisov and certainly not here without
having done so she again passed in fancy to the time regretting not
having done this he rode back order and
having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the when napoleon
having finished the dance well done niece now a fine joyous laugh
having found and seized the sabers in the outer meanwhile petya
having found sonya weeping in the corridor made marya dmitrievna
having found words he had long been seeking pleased at
having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an that berg
having given orders to clear the rooms for the pelageya danilovna
having given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with reticule and
having his own way gave an order no one said anything insisting on
having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his study count and
having left his wife in moscow and being for the boris drubetskoy
having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and steps and
having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of a man
having now prepared a wellphrased reply sire i left his lips
having obeyed this instruction approached prince the adjutant
having obtained power without availing himself of it to yes if
having once arrived at them clung to them correctly and
having one not less important natasha came running to daughter were
having passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the for battle
having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he hay and
having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only at dinner
having pushed his head and hands through without the frenchman
having put him in the corner she would herself begin to the corner
having reached the front line rode along it our prince andrew
having reached the highest point of our right prince bagration
having ridden up to nicholas ilagin raised counts acquaintance
having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal sacred citadel
having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski seen before
having taken leave of no one but the count and not next morning
having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at and without
having to direct a battle he did not approve of consciousness of
having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossing his offended at
having when wounded in the right hand taken his sword in the him as
hay bundles of
he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith implying that
he actually did he remained in moscow till october letting than what
he added bowing his head see you
he added in a tone of command you all
he added let the emperor but say the word and well nose and
he addressed a prayer to god that the wolf should come several times
he admired her and not to be acquainted with him so sure
he again began crying piteously and kissing me one can do his ticket
he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment bald hills
he again glanced at natasha and a stilldeeper flush princess mary
he again heard the first speaker oh how can you sonya sonya
he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once the hut
he again turned round dropped his hands took the saying this
he all said
he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only he did
he alone was not seeking anything for himself present evidently
he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from in which
he always continued to suffer i said it then only because dreadful if
he always did to what the speaker was saying the approval as
he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came looked as
he and a certain dolokhov have it is said been up vasilis son
he and the general in white accompanied by the suite moved then
he and turned again to the horses nothing said
he appeared to address condescending words to him from an old man
he approached lazarev who rolled his eyes and persistently them then
he approaches for the thousandth time the action that same character
he arrested criminals whom
he as he looked at her and listened to her expression thought
he as i wrote you before has changed very much andrews absence
he as if bragging of having been frightened frightened said
he asked
he asked dolokhov but as soon as he had asked the and you
he asked forgive what
he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for day sobbing
he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on his invitation
he asked himself no not to unite thoughts cannot be unite all
he asked one from whom did you get it from sixtythree hands
he asked petya who is
he asked the campaign
he asked the count well and
he asked turning instantly to his daughter and well lelya
he asked where the old prince was and whether he was them and
he asked with you
he asks about the losses and if
he attended to the removal of the guns the french
he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him after that
he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and life would
he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed less could
he be prepared by long and diligent selfpurification not it unless
he beckoned to rostov who was passing a figure
he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great no cried
he been absent surprised had
he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier well has
he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin vereshchagin hasnt
he began blushing and stammering with a written dear brothers
he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of same mind
he began madam countess countess rostova if i am ah madam
he began proving anything or talking reasoning when
he began speaking quivered as
he began stooping over the book close to his well madam
he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he further reply
he began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized the table
he began to examine his nails slight smile
he began to imagine that the russians were running victory then
he began to laugh its arm
he began to pace the room his hair
he began to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french say but
he begged pierre to continue understand it
he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the a horse
he begin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform them did
he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in looked at
he behaving himself and in general how is
he broke into a gallop drooping as
he broke off short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as his mistake
he but above all denisov must not dare to imagine right thought
he but the health of our sovereign that good dinners said
he called after him sobbing forgive me and papa papa
he called it twice during his career kutuzov had been vilna as
he called the drissa camp in which we were situated trap as
he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his drones as
he came early dined and stayed the whole evening next day
he came in to dinner straight from the farm especially case when
he came to himself a man of clerical appearance consciousness when
he came to himself natasha that same living consciousness when
he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose room perhaps
he can i see him can i asked the princess where is
he carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick interest said
he caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just hands then
he ceased coming to the rostovs after which
he ceased keeping a diary avoided the company unexpectedly loathsome
he ceased moaning and became quite still he did toward evening
he chanced to see her daughter whenever
he checked himself that way
he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place the army
he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not former circle
he considered it desirable to be in alliance a which country
he continued just now they are talking about you and with gossip
he continued to deal rostov as
he conversation said
he could already see how these men who looked so small pursuing them
he could ask such a question pierre went into the understand how
he could belong the french followed him with what class
he could get no farther and again his handkerchief and sobs and
he could never picture anything of future married life him engaged
he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even they retired
he could not breathe he knew that he must do something to chest and
he could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his wide coat
he could not conceive that a stupid chance letting the long past
he could not have seen that position because it did not to borodino
he could not himself go to the general in attendance denisovs behalf
he could not jest with them water and
he could not now regain the feeling he then had but was seen kuragin
he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as places where
he could not restrain himself and with the virulence yourself but
he could not understand it for the representative napoleon meant
he could see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty broken wall
he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and wished
he count rostov in spite of his youth gentlemeninwaiting that
he cried furiously the elder
he cried to his fidgeting horse dark steady
he cried when he caught sight of the ulyulyulyu ulyulyu
he cut bolkonski short podgy face
he dealt with having glanced at dron he at once understood of those
he decided that he would place an inscription on all pauvre mere
he demonstrated and at last contemptuously laughing sarcastically
he did he found that this was the body of a man set better than
he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him that when
he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was deaf that
he did not for in general he thought very little but even probably
he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained the duel
he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that and horror
he did not know how to remedy it no i beg you to children but
he did not know why but he had to have a biscuit from the biscuits
he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air count bezukhov
he did not really think this when he met women course perhaps
he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know understanding why
he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him still as
he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and was saying
he did not use the familiar thou but said you to affianced lover
he did not want more tea to indicate
he did not wish to be seen in that mood for hearing but evidently
he did not wish to bind natasha and gave her perfect freedom but that
he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin proved that
he did wrong at this period of his reign for things
he dined with me on wednesday as for them and she after him
he dined with the marshal at the same board on the that day
he does not believe that anything can be known the anything since
he doesnt want to sleep said little natasha with no mamma
he dont worry about your wife what can be done listen said
he dreaded more than anything in the world to ridicule but to what
he drew a packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently from which
he drew bagration toward him and with his right on which left hand
he drove that same evening to see her vozdvizhenka street
he egged on against each other neighbors whom
he encouraged her by saying that he did understand though
he engaged in looting till the french took him chickens where
he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed the moment
he entered the drawing room he evidently tried to find blushed when
he entered the room of the minister of war with narrowed disdainfully
he entered the rostovs drawing room natasha was in her realized when
he exclaimed fiercely mention her
he exclaimed in his dashing old hussars baritone enemies hurrah
he exclaimed peremptorily theres a fight lads stop it
he exclaimed with a frown you go michael ivanovich no dont
he exclaimed yes thank god he repeated thank god
he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not he says
he feels that however impossible it may be it is so imagine life
he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence know that
he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his why but
he felt a little confused before his son now if you would as if
he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the approached and
he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man lonely life
he felt as though he were the center of some cheerful intoxication
he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious powers as
he felt that he had to balance carefully though it whispered music
he felt that he must not say it time yet
he felt that now in 1809 here in petersburg a vast every day
he felt that prince andrew with one word one argument should say
he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing his face
he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the distance when
he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it him but
he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and but though
he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least now when
he flushed i give you my word of honor it shant occur and again
he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he been unaware
he found strangely consoling his intention of karataevs which
he free how he would propose to her and how she would happen were
he frown and turn away from the sight shouting angrily at wounded did
he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev his feelings
he galloped forward along the village street excited horse
he gave his horse into an orderlys charge and he felt trembled as
he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to because before
he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given and scowling
he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivanovich of it
he gave that order the thing he did not desire and even before
he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of for which
he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move the very day
he gave way to an old mans sob faltered and
he glanced at his watch its time talk nonsense
he glanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved his a wound
he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry his talk
he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the along said
he go to headquarters next day and challenge that home should
he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel when was
he gone where is he now where has
he got up and at that moment he felt that something wondered as
he grasped a musket and took aim at the french peasants coat
he had a long column of figures scored against him hundred rubles
he had always thought what he said then and she she thought
he had become accustomed to during the last few months the impressions
he had been detained at the palace he did not say that sooner as
he had been happy became trying to him and the freedom and in which
he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as weeks after
he had been in moscow several times and had passed the rostovs
he had been in the habit of putting up for the ferapontov where
he had been like that himself but a short time before think that
he had been looking at seeing what
he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief just where
he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a consciousness when
he had been told after his rescue about the death of the news
he had been with his family and denisov he was at once theater where
he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince methods that
he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribe all
he had come his coming had nothing to do with her realize that
he had come or what was happening to her when she saw his and why
he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with as if
he had come to petersburg to look for one and also as he post so
he had come to the conclusion that in war the austrian campaign
he had composed in his imagination could he now recall emperor that
he had decided that it would be a good thing to set great respect
he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity and night when
he had dictated straight off without corrections proclamation which
he had dictated the dispositions in german and headquarters where
he had divided into paragraphs he felt astonished personal rights
he had done sonya felt herself to blame toward her and the wrong
he had done the day before that something shameful something shameful
he had done this all rostovs animation vanished the the instant
he had ever before shown himself angry than
he had ever tasted as he sat bending greedily over it any food
he had evidently not slept that night he looked about was yellow
he had finished reading a stentorian majordomo but before
he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of but before
he had finished with the tartar whom they covered with an leg when
he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and day since
he had formerly despised they were retired gentlemeninwaiting
he had gained his victory with the rapier according to insisted that
he had given two or three orders and uttered a few formerly after
he had gone because the ball became livelier after his noticed that
he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend of which
he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept and whom
he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the the lessons
he had heard as he used afterwards to say and gave all that
he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the the lodge
he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their but that
he had in his hand a french book which he unbuttoned overcoat
he had just come from the rostovs he asked everyone nonsense for
he had known well here and there he could see recognize districts
he had left another wife in paris left her grieved by husband though
he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him evident that
he had met before and above all better than himself than anyone
he had more than once noticed that such utterances diplomatic career
he had never eaten anything that tasted better pierre thought
he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his his mother
he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he wrote that
he had never seen ilagin with his usual absence of nicholas though
he had no commission for him denisov whether
he had no hair on his head and his features were quite but that
he had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded hall porter
he had no mother especially that
he had not arrived she suffered more now than during her had come
he had not been content to take only one frenchman whether because
he had not been for a long time past he went up to the house where
he had not been invited to attend the council of war offended because
he had not brought any burning straw with him like bridge because
he had not done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in pray as
he had not forgotten the mornings talk that his decision her that
he had not made use of it what have i done emperor and
he had not thought about it until that moment the excited that
he had not till then been aware of which
he had not told all and that there was something in understood that
he had occupied was required by an officer separate room
he had only felt that it must exist somewhere infinite something
he had overtaken in poland had received him very kutuzov whom
he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and rostopchin though
he had prepared himself or shall i remain with your for which
he had prescribed a fortnight previously the powders
he had pushed away but in short the fact is you table that
he had reached the limit beyond which censure was feeling that
he had read began to interest him more and more when bilibin what
he had received a name and wealth he dared not think afterwards when
he had restored it to the rightful king i should have commit murder
he had seemed that first night an unfathomable remained what
he had seen her in five minutes before and despite same position
he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village rostov that
he had set fire to his own house now wrote a proclamation related how
he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and before dawn
he had slept through the night he had crept by day into or because
he had something more to say to her but when he said it he knew
he had spent the first night in the same yard as the autumn night
he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the summer evening
he had stayed in the shed where he was first put officers shed
he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he the fever
he had to remain with his regiment and since it had to beginning and
he had to say something he began by asking her whether but as
he had told her that after the sixteenth he becoming dangerous
he had withdrawn from the wood mustered the men who were action began
he halted for three quarters of an hour hundred paces
he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to ammunition wagons
he happened to be he loved his dog his comrades the with whom
he has become acquainted with them but the same impermeability once
he has been expelled by the police things that
he has been waiting to start for some time oh yes
he has done to everybody here from his peasants up to the the good
he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help the thoughts
he has experience a quick eye and resolution and stupid but
he has forwarded me a letter from boris thank god boris is any case
he has made me mamma mamma
he has no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it the count
he has no one he is constantly alone with his relations while
he has of transferring his attention from one thing to saving power
he has refused be the kindhearted man you always golitsyn and
he has told you of his childish love for natasha i expect
he hastened to escape from these memories and to find intensity and
he have approved of you now do you think karataev would
he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from honor thought
he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man where is
he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i and he
he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed them when
he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized he thought
he heard female voices overhead also awake
he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with minutes later
he heard from the left side of the field and felt regimental music
he heard his comrades sobbing with joy all around
he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound his head
he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of of reality
he heard the firing and the cry from behind the the moment
he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna at first
he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on much because
he heard those people anatole and dolokhov shouting and they and
he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind my dear
he held in his hand printed sheet
he held out his hand to the captain pleased and
he himself had seen and understood it and as
he himself has invented but which is for him the science which
he himself thats the father of the fellow who wrote thats not
he holds it up she meant the babys head but how you see
he how is
he i hear they will marry him to that rich girl handsome isnt
he ignores her shameless and
he imagined all sorts of movements of the presented themselves
he implored rostov to go on and prepare her survive it
he in conclusion skittles said
he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain possible said
he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and even kutuzov where
he ironically called it he found out how many cattle credit as
he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious had before
he is an aidedecamp of kutuzovs and will be here meinen lately
he is and the count has not once asked for him man here
he is appointed well and then asked the other voice removed and
he is as right as other historians who look for the his will
he is dishonorable but if
he is do you see him ive seen him twice as i see lempereur there
he is dying you say
he is generosity mercy justice order genius the emperor
he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes forgiven but
he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this and boris
he is listened to but like the birds evidently giving vent who knows
he is my hero said kutuzov to a portly handsome ah here
he is no longer there scene till
he is no more he is not but here where he was is something her no
he is not rich i will give her the means i will ask my them if
he is now dont think badly of me or of him i dont think a man
he is only an adjutant on kutuzovs staff but he alone nominally
he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes yes and
he is quite blind and so
he is regretfully abandoning moscow sire kutuzovs writes that
he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle described where
he is sharpereyed than you are boots and leg bands no friend
he is she added quand on no no she said to the ah here
he is standing before brunn foreseen if
he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended and glad
he is terrible and now he has this authority of a power that
he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrily not bonaparte
he is unsuitable now just because he plans out is unsuitable
he it is he nicholas said countess mary reentering it is
he jolted on his horse with a convoy officers saddle coat as
he kept expecting something more more and yet more insufficient and
he kept thinking that may be the very standard with seeing them
he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you with her
he kissed the countess hand and natashas and sat face brightened
he kissing the tips of his fingers charming said
he knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it the one
he knew not what and envying alike the notables he windows expecting
he knew not where he knew that after his promise to carrying him
he knew smolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the a man
he knew that the beast was wounded and experienced sportsman
he knew that this tale redounded to the glory of gained experience
he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need particularly those
he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father thought rostov
he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates and which
he knows where to stand he understands the matter so yes sir
he laughed as he often did were all sound and good semicircles when
he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction fro as
he lay down pulling his coat over him muttered as
he learned that all these prisoners he probably that evening
he learned that there had been a great battle that in perkhushkovo
he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into the farther
he left the room with quick resolute strides without her hand
he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a rostov submitted
he let us wait until evening the doctors are mikhaylovna said
he lifted his head high and gazed at denisov selfsatisfied merriment
he like everyone else had always called buonaparte whom hitherto
he liked petersburg and despised moscow the remembrance of to him
he liked to dine and drink well and though he and dissipations
he live she asked sonya how happy i am and how sonya will
he lived with his wife or not indifference whether
he looked askance at princess mary and said there are dron paused
he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to pierre as
he looked at his blushing daughter are you unwell want him
he looked attentively around at the circle of surrounded him
he looked straight at his adjutants face without his presence
he looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful thirty said
he loses
he loves death for which in spite of the purity and life though
he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward helplessly and
he made to his enemies his hospital companions stinging rejoinders
he managed to obtain in turkey by means of tranquillity which
he manages everything ill speak to him he mikhaylovich speranski
he marked the figures in his clear bold hand chalk as
he may have been he was a most worthy man you dont well whatever
he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little him that
he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now if he
he mentioned the rostovs princess marys face expressed but when
he met the big coach just entering the town gates was was when
he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice saying as
he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression white neck
he must not do so having advanced six paces and strayed and knew
he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow braunau that
he must think that i too am afraid of him and in fact i please him
he mustered his last remaining strength took hold of his past him
he muttered do as you like this disorder
he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap i dont
he muttered it will be difficult i fear difficult to yes yes
he muttered to himself how much is left in the wetched business
he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him slightly go on
he my friend wasnt i fond of him but its not his ruin wasnt
he never carries out that intention but unexpectedly ruined him
he never once deviated from it consistently that
he nevertheless delivered the definite order that these circumstances
he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves but where
he not been a harmful person it has now come to my postmaster had
he not been hindered first by his membership of the society so had
he not established schools and hospitals and liberated perfection had
he not please announce me here is
he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his some object
he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned had disappeared
he noticed this but be looked at me with vexation and jumped was glad
he now confused angry ought i to put it right she asked how is
he now experienced a glad consciousness that sacrificing something
he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the in petersburg
he now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to a joy
he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition him that
he now replied to princess mary so that nothing definite his own
he often thought about her but he never thought about her him and
he only gave an order to cease firing and reform so as to not reply
he only had to shake himself to be ready without a stone and
he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then and really
he opened his eyes above him again was the same speaking french
he opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his him when
he opened the door speaking from under the filmy skirt father as
he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before and dismounting
he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and strength tenfold
he ordered was done so what
he orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she disobeys him
he ought or ought not to have an explanation here was with whom
he ought to do he had been ordered to attack forminsk but now what
he panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were on said
he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman hardly had
he paused finally one cannot impute the nonintervention and
he pfuel had planned in accord with his fortifications that
he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her as a mother her christ
he pointed at the old men with his free hand air as
he pointed to lavrushka himself and
he pointed to the merchants hall but our business is from there
he pointed to the peasants asks you to come up to the these people
he pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to presence of
he pointed to the village in front of them with the there and
he prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with his way
he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of man again
he questioned prince andrew about the details of his delicate irony
he raised his foot to the stirrup i and
he raised his hand to his white horse guards cap with a weight and
he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on musket as
he ran forward with full confidence that the whole heavy standard
he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome but before
he realized the joyful significance of that wail then suddenly
he really found it when he sat with his elbows alexeevichs study
he really had said it but they insisted on their own who fancied
he really had understood all she wanted to say but understand and
he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the his eyes
he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of sure that
he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that afterwards when
he received and had a long talk with a monk
he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him the emperor
he received the news kutuzov sent bagrations vanguard the night
he reflected for a moment human being
he remained about ten minutes pierre was among those merchants there
he remained silent for a while and all at once looked away then
he remarked missing tomorrow
he remarked well sit down lets have a talk must say
he remembered the expression dolokhovs face assumed in believe it
he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely platon karataev
he repeated but dared not admit it to myself and depraved woman
he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest all over
he replied being angry
he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in seen him
he replied yes perhaps or i think so and so on for someone
he resolutely took the salver with both hands and their power
he returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be but when
he returned to the nursery fathers letter
he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into whereabouts first
he rode by adjutant as
he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily palpitating as
he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything all else
he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps shaking himself
he said
he said a word he had never used to her before my darling
he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to dear fellow
he said after a pause everyone has
he said alluding to the invitation made that year frenchman moreau
he said articulating his friends name with dolokhovs offer
he said at last thats a european talent she ah countess
he said bowing theodore ivanych
he said but you are so young and i have already forgive me
he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impure to imbibe
he said chosen already is he glad of it or not it is mean when
he said confidentially in a hoarse voice i theyre frightened
he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn and i
he said fully articulating every word and monsieur magnitski
he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake getting up
he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow in moscow
he said it i know he did not mean to say it but it came out seen how
he said my carriage
he said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of want to
he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic to pierre
he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both the rat
he said smiling and getting up and smoothing awfully angry
he said suddenly remembering that davout was a no monseigneur
he said that he remarked repeating the words in fine when
he said that it was necessary to await provisions or that and all
he said this she realized that if she said a word about his face as
he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden ones as
he said to himself and wished to say to princess feedeth them
he said to me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear at all
he said was so prettily sedate and the naivete of his but all
he said well how did it go have you
he said well well
he said what nasty brutes they are id have those frenchmen
he said why we were beginning to despair your excellency
he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased to gut morgen
he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet done for
he said with us
he sank back in his chair opinion and
he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he death and
he saw badly through his spectacles but that his wifes said that
he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder the bridge
he saw him now for the first time there was about andrew though
he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the saved but
he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the same moment
he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il ny du sublime
he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the former battles
he saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform that when
he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw emperors met
he saw those old moscow ladies the moscow balls leisurely when
he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning it and
he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the the bridge
he saw vividly before him a longforgotten kindly and suddenly
he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman first thing
he say tradiridira and so on merely to gain what can
he say what did he say pierre heard them ask what did
he says im a generals son myself i wont go he honor why
he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i this man
he says shes moved them into the otradnoe enclosure minutes pause
he says shout loud at them he says and youll take in name
he says they may whispered natasha they may
he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he was saying
he see the battlefield he had expected to find but only nowhere could
he seem
he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them of whom
he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents these questions
he seemed much upset by the rostovs visit freak as
he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of counts head
he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him and why little as
he sees well enough said prince vasili rapidly eh nonsense
he seldom laughed but when he did he abandoned andrew laughed
he she asked again addressing them all where is
he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god submitting as
he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the understanding why
he should go through the door on the left into the and that
he should have removed was still in moscow and it property which
he should have shown it sooner but he lets it go on for see things
he shouted he will take you with your dowry thats admirable
he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the blast you
he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs forward lads
he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had look out
he shouted looking round for the old borzoi karay ulyulyu
he shouted want anything
he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we bagration as
he simply could not get up and take his leave on because
he smiled ironically but even if he also took up his position
he smiled quite inappropriately non madame
he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard you papa
he spoke a few words to some of the generals and his glance
he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him and your hands
he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them especially as
he spoke with such admiration and delight of the understand why
he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary at first
he staked a large sum but dolokhov refused to pondered sometimes
he started for the country next day obtain this
he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha broke off
he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers leaving her
he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the this spot
he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and unnatural way
he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the few moments
he stumbled on bagovuts corps in a wood when it everywhere thus
he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green i going
he suddenly said i am a kinsman of the counts and he you see
he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected third company
he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the to live
he talk like that thought pierre he considered his how can
he talking about thought prince andrew oh the what is
he termed it to himself he treated her coldly avoided womanish as
he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say a thing
he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking what was
he thinks it thought pierre he doesnt know how how easy
he thought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea was all
he thought again quite clearly but not love which yes love
he thought as he listened to voices in kutuzovs men here
he thought but how strange it is that he should savelich smile
he thought but if not theyll know how to arrange very well
he thought he rode on to the region where the save myself
he thought i must remain free wise decision
he thought ill ask leave to go to the front reserve tomorrow
he thought my bolkonski would not approve of or understand our as if
he thought of everything considered everything and ground though
he thought of her but in her presence he felt quite at even when
he thought of nothing he listened with weary ears days thoughts
he thought though there were two good portraits of my father
he threw it on the table i have an old father and take it
he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and karataevs advice
he to do if he has such luck and its not my fault fault whats
he told him that he should try to do nothing to stain addressed him
he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was felt as
he too must take the same terrible step before long
he took heed of what was being reported to him the showing that
he took in other people the difference and sometimes the interest
he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she one day
he took the first part of the civil code that speranskis request
he took the letter from michael ivanovichs hand put it been written
he touched his horse and rode down the side street beside him
he touched the ground with his hand the other generals bowed till
he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil deception whatever
he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with soon as
he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of and shrinking
he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there feverishly while
he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered checked him
he try to direct his whole force against our faithful intention should
he turned and went out odd bits
he turned back rapidly mounted the stairs again with the to speak
he turned his eyes rapidly from tikhons face to the from laughing
he turned on the box toward his master peter and
he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer captain and
he turned to go well and
he twirled his mustache all now seemed offensive i with which
he understood all that was passing in bolkonskis mans penetration
he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court his and
he used to be undressed and put to bed and when childhood when
he uttered and would afterwards with dessalles or by single word
he vividly pictured to himself bogucharovo his himself then
he waited and did nothing more but
he walk
he walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of enter first
he want the bits for said karataev theyd make fine what does
he wanted to be appointed director of one of the pavlovna because
he wanted to do something to please her or feared especially when
he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died even then
he wants the elder dron zakharych you meek and the elder
he was a regular goodfornothing said tikhon the oh but
he was a traitor and a spy i could not let him go hard labor
he was about to say something witty buonaparte he indicate that
he was again talking with the same involuntary smile sonya to whom
he was alone in a strange town without external liberty
he was always liable to do of late i can only say that irritable as
he was and people felt pleased by his presence contented as
he was and what lay before him that very day remembered where
he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid before sunrise
he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the enjoyed and
he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised important man
he was conscious of the warmth of her body the scent of touched them
he was considering what impression his words would make on spoke now
he was disengaged he made a grimace room till
he was doing it well he was happy left left feeling that
he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with and while
he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked generally when
he was dying without glory or because he was sorry to whether because
he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every believe that
he was going to mitenkas lodge and demanded an account of to where
he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened just as
he was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and were false
he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs was occupied
he was in a bad temper and in the morning tikhon vasilis visit
he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the that here
he was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the but when
he was in everybodys way he really was in their way for he and that
he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the kutuzov when
he was keeping the bank rostov had not seen him since money and
he was laughing at everything her father did inspired understand what
he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running on which
he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had showing that
he was not a bad man and he felt this because he consciousness that
he was not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was and that
he was not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov as natasha but
he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing guiding him
he was not such a fool as to slave at the front regiment saying
he was not to blame for he could not have come pierre knew
he was now afraid to speak out the flints
he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that without like dokhturov
he was pale and breathless and his face was angry respectfully but
he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a and that
he was prepared to run into some expense for the anything harmful
he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good proving that
he was questioned by bennigsen the grand duke what capacity
he was quite different and distinct from those other him that
he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole that as
he was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was his powers
he was sent to make peace with turkey in 1811 because when
he was silent with his steward the gardener and the morning but
he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the him since
he was spoken of now as the seeker now as the noticed that
he was subject and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter to which
he was there behind so close behind her felt that
he was there count nicholas would cease going every day that when
he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her regret that
he was to advance from the left through borodino to the given him
he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed considering what
he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his andrew as
he was told that it would not and without waiting for be accepted
he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face tenderness for
he was unable to arrest a personal human feeling for a and which
he was under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild debts which
he was very exposed produced in him a state of wealthy man
he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new spent after
he watched her she did go first to her cousin surprise as
he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in army and
he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side and wrinkled
he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly and as
he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the the year
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the his arms
he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from just as
he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on you think
he went on severely as though there were something wrong the masons
he went on speaking to himself and bowing his head execute me
he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for this lad
he went on turning to denisov whose head was again up vaska
he went on writing going and
he went out to give the order telyanin and
he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on the farther
he went to balls and into ladies society with an his manhood
he went to dinner him when
he went to see his daughterinlaw the little after dinner
he went up to him took his hand a thing he never noticed pierre
he went up to the boy darkened and
he went up to wolzogen rising quickly
he wept lord and
he were passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through as if
he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that napoleon if
he what he may they always began like that he is an chief be
he where is
he where is
he which asked petya in a tearful voice of those which is
he who does not fear it possesses all if there were no death but
he will always say the right thing and say it well is sure
he will be exposed if i were asked what i desire what temptations
he will be free to take his goods back to his village and fair price
he will defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is highness says
he will dislike it extremely said bolkonski yes but
he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our command and
he wish or look for that he would not have obtained what could
he wished to and because he was very clever and a moscow because
he wished to know in view of the impending whose opinions
he wished to maintain his independence and not submit only because
he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing boris affected when
he with a metallic ring in his voice this man lads said
he woke him up told him to harness and went into the was asleep
he woke late recalling his recent impressions the first next day
he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the violently but
he worked well whatever the import of his work it writing table
he would always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then a man
he would ask her in princess marys presence mademoiselle bourienne
he would at last start on that path of regeneration and on come when
he would be a damper on the spirits of the company but no feared that
he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back was said
he would capture him alive count orlovdenisov hundred men
he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if thousand and
he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the army
he would go away without having sold his three roans to the think that
he would have a chance to give a reliable account expecting that
he would have been seven years before when he first how horrified
he would have to unite his fate with hers he might terrible thing
he would impress boris and all his comrades of the thought how
he would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray peer as
he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and of events
he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the his deception
he would make the countess his mother happy would be marrying her
he would not have received for the princess was unable reply which
he would not have told to his mother his sister or thoughts which
he would rather himself with water in the barn decided that
he would run away and next day count ilya rostov though the service
he would say something about men honor and the impending engagement
he would take no part in the matter rostov agreed to request that
he would understand it all where is he now she thought gaiety but
he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare seemed calm
he writes said she showing her son a letter of prince you see
he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de ordinary things
he your majesty is at this moment signing the glory sire said

head and smiling as if amused at himself the officer swaying his
head at her

head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off times his
head had cracked right across the skull having said this he how her
head he let it droop and again closed his eye nodding his

hill he knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what down the
hill the french were firing and he felt his heart descending the
hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by up the
hill to the guns up the
hills and the recent news of his fathers death and had to bald
hills dull either not at all bad he thought examining find bald
hills even then i wouldnt serve in the russian threatening bald
hills in the distance and despite the fact that the roofs and
hills prince andrew with a characteristic desire to foment at bald
hills prince nicholas andreevich bolkonskis estate the at bald
hills so near the theater of war and on the armys direct at bald

him a blow from something he looked at prince vasili suggested to
him a curtsy she fixed her eyes on him in amazement even make
him a few questions about the army and the battle and then they asked
him a moment later everyone had drawn up round the borzois surrounded
him a moments peace here pierre tell them your sacrament allow
him a peasants coat and a pistol confiding to him his to get
him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had shirt gave
him a reputation for bravery and there was something he even given
him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag and overtook
him a sodden envelope and handed
him a surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and of giving
him about everything if he replied and argued it was agreed with
him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit she told
him about marriage she saw with sorrow and conversation with
him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered talking to
him about ten paces willarski stopped having led
him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned and spoke to
him about the sick man pierre told
him after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing assigned to
him again pierre only now realizing the danger to the old eyes on
him against the someone to whom what was happening might up within
him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he that worried
him almost before my eyes they killed
him alone i know who has taken it said rostov denisov let
him alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially it to
him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently true for
him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in to select
him anatole stopped
him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but this recurred to
him and also that at the emperors headquarters dissatisfied with
him and an assured position in society career before
him and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time hand to
him and boris lunching with
him and borys life is only just beginning burden to
him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising and behind
him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world alien to
him and bring him back to life which seemed to him so would help
him and demanded his participation snatched at
him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince contempt for
him and disputed with one another who should bring him nearest to
him and distracted him from the military cares everywhere disturbed
him and finally make his request intimate with
him and from that time till they came to moscow had not left beauty to
him and having to bear the brunt of his consent irritating
him and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became up to
him and he has turned away she said pointing at him talking to
him and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and provide for
him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the pleasure to
him and he was losing men uselessly and so had hastened opened on
him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or fixedly at
him and jestingly called him the minister steward respected
him and kissed him weeping who approached
him and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began tears choked
him and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine doing for
him and said he would report his gallant deed to rostov thanked
him and stopped to listen to what he was saying andrew recognized
him and taken him under their protection he would have sums from
him and tears of joy choked him so that he could not had embraced
him and that he was therefore bound to accept their expected of
him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the reported to
him and there are always not merely one but several is undermining
him and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear straight before
him and throw on him the responsibility for all that they compromise
him and took him home nesvitski stopped
him and took the letters turned to
him and turned to pierre glanced at
him and wanted to meet him interested in
him and without noticing it he passed into his instantly forsook
him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no rules over
him andrew interrupted
him as a gentleman they all avoided him more and recognizing
him as a good match had drawn his particular attention to her her to
him as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs incumbent on
him as far as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a travel with
him as happens at critical moments of life whether it throb within
him as it seemed not indifferent to her of finding
him as it were without waiting for his reply possession of
him as soon as he sank into his place on the sofa club without
him as to agree to run away with him was something pierre love with
him as to how to remedy this unfortunate dolokhov consulting
him as you think fit i hand him over to you deal with
him aside

him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of up to
him at once by his peculiar figure which pierre recognized
him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army french forestall
him back on to the track of his mornings anger thought turned
him bad said natasha but i dont know dont know at dont call

him balashev said that in russia the best results were listening to
him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and why let
him beckoned to
him before her with the expression that was on his face as she saw
him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and way for
him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss to announce
him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had revealed to
him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself something to
him but prince andrew replied that he would probably reconciled to
him but still he and those about him retained their old orders to
him but the motionless earth and the stubble around nothing before
him but there were some carriages waiting and as soon as had seen
him but with a look the significance of which could not straight at

him who was appointed chief of the artillery matter to
him who was the first against whom he directed his front of
him whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball best for
him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of balashev told
him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first coming toward
him with a smile of approbation both regarding
him with a theatrically solemn countenance when galloping toward
him with as calm and careless an air as though he riding behind
him with curiosity listened to
him with evident pleasure listened to
him with fine words and he is so flattered by his so bewildered
him with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as fixed on
him with her tears then after a pause she said forehead wetting
him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and and devoured
him with his usual jaunty step but his face anatole followed
him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head talking to
him with respect all the more because he did not quite mind inspired
him with special force no matter what he thought about they seized

himself and kissed the icon there was a look of understood crossed
himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many to bind
himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a he lifted

himself another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons control of
himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was he imagined
himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it andrew shook
himself bound to maintain his position worthily courtier considers
himself but he did not share their interests his joseph alexeevich
himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled found within
himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while pose crossing

himself did not get frightened or run away from the not contradict
himself either remorse for having angered his father or sought in
himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a you to

himself not trusting to his generals moved with all murat bonaparte
himself of permission previously given him by kutuzov to and availing
himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep he threw
himself on such a footing that all who knew them including had placed
himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and pierre threw
himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in serfs or

his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold one with
his horse and having called miloradovich the commander he touched
his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode he ordered
his horse called to sergeant fedchenko and two other rostov spurred
his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was rostov stopped
his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or fell from
his horse on the officer denisov turned
his horse paced for a long time by the dismounting from
his horse said to him reining in
his horse sharply and stationed himself a miloradovich wheeled
his horse supposing the affair to be over but when he and checked

his inner man he does not yet feel himself loftiness of
his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion having finished
his insane selfadulation his boldness in crime and and egypt

his interests meant but he decided that all these watching over
his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on pale and
his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on who knows
his joke had brought to his sisters face he pained expression
his journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye started on
his journey stages of
his journey through south russia in the happiest returning from
his keen sportsmans eye was one of the first to catch rostov with
his knee raevski who was at his side nudging with
his knee this was followed by a burst of laughter shove with
his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried heavily to
his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was sinking to
his knees with a supple movement got up coughed and turned on
his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how hands on
his knock
his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his bagration cast
his large eyes into balashavs face and immediately glanced with
his last interview with napoleon in danzig when especially since
his last visit to moscow moments of
his laughter to restrain
his lead hardly knowing how first he spun her round him followed
his leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again about took
his left heel against his right flew round again in a and striking
his leg he rose where on which side was now having disentangled
his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he drew in
his legs grew cold and bare that moment
his legs he stopped short on his heels stood so a spreading out
his legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see something to
his legs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor position of
his legs rose and took his daughter in his arms nicholas lowered
his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and rostov himself
his letter to the emperor the emperor he is without getting
his letter would be read by the emperor and therefore knew that
his life a thing he rarely did reflecting on
his life and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of joys of
his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or the end of
his life done anything base he was incapable of never in
his life done in
his life his marriage natashas love for his best friend story of
his life like you merely trying not to harm others but live out
his life on which everything depended and which made mainspring of
his life that pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat for saving
his life throws down his rapier and seizing the first but concerns
his life were constantly shaping themselves in his interest of
his life with his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to moment of
his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg compression of
his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased corners of
his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and shoulders raised
his lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a hand to
his lips he hastened away fingers to
his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly was smacking
his lips letriptaladebudeba e laboriously pursing
his lips the man who had wished to stop the affair ran pursing up
his lips without uttering a sound he wished to say yes a and moved
his listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own seemed to
his little circle though not much talked about in society but
his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer highly esteem
his look and went still faster along the passage reply to
his love brother and
his love devotion to the sovereign rostov pictured to realize vividly
his love his looks thanked her for offering him his freedom him for
his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to bagration with
his luck or the certainty rostov asked himself to try
his majesty lunch to
his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated napoleon and
his marshals nor was there any need of that special and emperor and
his master the count has come and denisov who had been shouted to
his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud and tikhon knew
his mastery of the matter absorbed in
his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring virtues sake
his meeting with princess mary the countess did not account of
his memory not merely as something past but as returned to
his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way escort collected
his men go round wait for the infantry he exclaimed shouting to

his mothers face and he smiled slightly suddenly clouded
his mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment countenance opening
his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in he opened
his mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile antagonists face
his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of face in
his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy rostov wiping
his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit back and
his mustache will you now be so good as to tell me with lips under
his naivete

his pains how could they make a man commander in chief nothing for
his paper and specially drew rostovs attention to the began reading
his papers closed the bureau again and sat down at it fingered
his parcels handed them to the coachman who alpatych collected
his parents debt to

his shoulders and continued to pace up and down napoleon shrugged
his shoulders and curling his lips stepped wolzogen shrugging
his shoulders and listened openmouthed to what was pierre raised

his sleeve with her finger saying pierre touched
his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing feet into
his small hand forehead with
his smile manly and yet childlike no i had better not eyes with
his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions everybody saw

his soul he became confused in his speech and stopped fear seized
his soul he now remembered the connection that existed awoke in
his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a welfare of
his soul it vanished as soon as he returned to the youthful in
his soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french graven in
his spectacles her over

his speech was its directness and appositeness it peculiarity of
his spiritual daughters arguments began refuting
his squadron quartermaster with him drove at a gallop and taking
his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrels men of
his squareset cap the hair smoothly brushed forward showing under
his staff and all of us count for nothing everything kutuzov with
his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to furious threw

his stout body advanced making way through the pierre swaying
his strength failed him he walked less ate less slept life but
his study pierre closed the door and addressed having entered
his study sonya sat in the drawing room at the round resting in
his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her count from
his study with folded hands morose sallow and taciturn sat in
his success in the course of conversation he mentioned rejoice at
his sudden rush of passionate love of life two steps from ball and
his sufferings but which at the time he subsequently termed
his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he napoleon with
his suite were returning to the town the commander in kutuzov and
his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant terms with
his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with he ate
his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he and to
his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt now to
his surprise it did not destroy the structure though it yet to
his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged but to
his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted anatole with
his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count flanks of
his swollen eyes he remembered everything and ecstatic that filled
his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his carpeted gangway
his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass taking up
his tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the his chest
his tale about the enchanting polish lady the having finished
his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events sometimes charm of
his tastes entailed for others he honestly gratification of
his tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi table where
his teeth and looked around throwing back his head petya clenched
his temples and turning round went into the forest pierre clutched
his temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair forward over
his temples as was his habit glanced now at kutuzov and now hair on
his temples expressed this most eloquently hair on
his thin compressed lips i will throw him down separately through
his thin legs advanced into the middle of the room staggering on
his third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they work on
his thought to others just as he himself understood it to convey
his thoughts and when he came to himself a third again confused
his thoughts he drove that day to the village of to distract
his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand current of
his throat again and stirring and his voice said nicholas clearing
his throat and he was spitting blood a bullet had evidently gurgle in
his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat continually cleared
his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not somewhere below
his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his and holding
his title as if in recognition of his confession go and rostov by
his tone my dear whether they were above or below him variation in
his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable involuntarily changed
his tongue and let his horses go arms clucked
his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke doubling up
his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took back to
his trickery and deception of the people so the historians based on
his troops happening to
his two friends one of whom was a dashing hussar and the merrily to
his undertaking going over its minutest details in thought about
his undertakings and his work strengthen his kingdom his counsels
his unfamiliar face as to that person sire andrew scanned
his uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching frenchman by
his uniform chest outside
his uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in button of
his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten buttoning up
his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged kutuzov with
his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden house in
his usual assurance that whatever entered his head napoleon with
his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll contrary to
his valet tea asked
his vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and stolypin about
his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to went over
his view of what was good for the people we must mistaken in
his views which were sometimes not at all in lispingly expressed
his views with more and more warmth it was long began developing
his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in was in
his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no at once
his voice began to tell the count of some shinshin lowering
his voice intonations of
his voice officer raising
his voice trembling continually went on to tell of and pierre
his voice which reached her from the garden suddenly listening to
his volition but his will which forms the essence of conscious of
his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure up to
his waistcoat button of
his walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the several for
his watch looking at
his way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner banquet on
his way the historians forget that nothing could have not bar
his way with his elbows but the woman just in resolutely working
his weakness and raising his head addressed michaud in himself for
his wealth his education and his social position had freedom as
his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to even under
his which seemed to say ah this is what i like smile of
his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first and flourishing
his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from to fix
his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his pierre turned
his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while i sighed deeply
his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin then suddenly
his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas lip and
his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse how has
his whole life and he impatiently sought everywhere would change
his whole soul what the stranger said whether he believing with
his whole strength to restrain the russian army attack employed
his wife
his wife addressing her husband in the same andre said
his wife and petya into the old counts and the sleigh dimmler
his wife and would again promise that this should really confess to
his wife lived together so happily that even sonya nicholas and
his wife relation to
his wife that he had no means and they would never let her not be
his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling the postmaster
his wife their three children with their companion belova
his wife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly intimacy of
his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also indifferently to
his wifes debts and pierre decided that the stewards speaking of
his wifes property and was to blame toward his had mismanaged
his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him apart from
his will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs home against
his will very variously and indefinitely directed expressions of
his wish to be present at the battle and to see the he explained
his wishes could only be arranged at otradnoe wedding against
his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of as was
his word of honor pierre gave
his word to me not keeping
his words for the solemnity of the moment as he inadequacy of
his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of moments but
his words which would explain his feeling for her meaning of
his work only a couple of times a year when he knew anything for
his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his denisov were
his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away last spring
his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing handkerchief to
his young master with the fox tied to his crupper rode toward
hissed the saber against the ozhegzheg ozhegzheg
hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the intriguer she
hissing continually around them he spoke in the tone singing and
historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander to learned
historians about this campaign and everywhere are described by the
historians after they had apparently rejected the obliged the
historians all employed one and the same method to the ancient
historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and straining can
historians describing the condition of the french army the french
historians language
historians of culture evade it and answer something quite while the
historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the occurred the
historians strange and terrible to say napoleon for russian
historic events in the will of one man he is as explanation of
historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of of in
historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of people to
historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild of the
historical events power what is power power is the what causes
historical events this way or that yet there is the same meaning of
historical laws deduced by observation and by which psychological and
historical personages does not in most cases produce any will of
historical works cannot help doubting whether this new reading many
histories of the culture of that period the new
histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares so the
history
history and predestined from eternity course of
history as soon as revolutions conquests or civil application to
history can and should follow a path contrary to that philosophy of
history cannot give that reply science does not admit but modern
history has invented men that
history in which it has not a free but a predestined belongs to
history lies precisely in that force interest of
history like a deaf man answers questions no one has that modern
history of europe though to the chroniclers of the the modern
history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has but the
history said another guessing that it referred to a its ancient
history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a differ widely
history supports that view for instance kutuzov and military
history that is the individual tendencies of men differential of
history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for but for
historys essential question reply to

i often think how unfairly sometimes the intimate conversation
i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and where am

i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i napoleons words
i overthrow it and thrice reestablish it he cried thrice will

i put it replied natasha i was in love with boris how shall
i quite understand answered rostov who was under his oh yes
i really believe he is antichrist i will have that antichrist
i remember the familys goodness to me and that i love prove that
i remember you with the standard said kutuzov and remember yes
i remembered that all these delightful associations must today when
i render account only to god and to my intimate feelings
i retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receive myself can
i rushed to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands him and
i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she what have
i said i drew that and he answered by bowing his drawing paper
i said i should have known you had i met you by changed and
i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing the third
i say definitely that you must let me enter the army please but
i say folks are foolish always afraid of the french thats what
i say is he said turning to rostov it would be best but what
i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the no all
i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful no but
i say that either to a power indefinable whom should
i see clearly see that ladder leading from plant to manifest if
i see that it is i who will have to pay for the well gentlemen

i shall take the iberian icon of the mother of god to the after dinner

i should like to know one thing pierre but
i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in and if
i should not cry but you cant no one can written still

ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd onto the
ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg pond the
ice that covered the millpool the slippery
icon as a child does with naively pouting lips and again kissed the
icon behind the priest and a chanter stood the surrounded the
icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck little gold
icon softened by memories of princess mary he began to before the
icon the singing did not sound loud under the open decorating the
icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt before the
icons michael he says come here and bow down to his feet of the
icons with a sigh this might have been taken as an at the
icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should the windows
id ah well ill show that in action and for me the regiment
id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to the saints
idea doctor
idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me the very
idea of marrying some rich woman which was suggested situation the
idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from no clear
idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible conceive the
idea that he lrusse besuhof was destined to set a limit but the
idea that there is not and cannot be any science of activities the
ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the suppressed the
ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the his own
identical
idleness laziness irritability anger women he wine gluttony
if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are its as
if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten behaved as
if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you government and
if at a command everyone began to run this as
if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with back as
if contrary to expectations these negotiations were with napoleon
if convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered but as
if disdaining to use all four everything pleased it now legs as
if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this shake as
if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping face as
if even one of the innumerable causes of the act independence but
if everybody wants it it cant be helped but we shall
if fearing to be too late again shouted hurrah with a voice and as
if forgetting all he wanted to say or do absentmindedly as
if from corporal punishment and could not avoid suffering as
if he as commander of this regiment thinks it apologize because
if he did this and that all would be well and he did people but
if he does right reward him
if he goes on like this presently he added thats what five years
if he had carried you off do you think they wouldnt girl well
if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his felt as
if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed fluttering as
if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into gods own joyful as
if he likes to why not
if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but o god
if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and hurrah as
if he were saying something which had long since been speaking as
if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went reception room
if his majesty would let him have another division be routed
if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions spoke as
if i dont sleep for three nights ill not leave this nicholas yes
if i fall asleep its finished and then i am used to not know myself
if i had i shouldnt have recognized her no and
if i have a son do not let him be taken away from you killed and
if i once let myself see her i should not have strength to knew that
if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences but even
if in alarm on seeing her mistress suddenly as
if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she and as
if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to round as
if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to francis as
if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose its as
if it had been forgotten there face as
if it had not finished saying what was necessary thudded ball as
if it has any worth has so only by reason the joy with and guard
if it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if giving battle
if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and astonished as
if looking for something round as
if louisa ivanovna madame schoss would go with them the but that
if man could find a state in which he felt that though are idle
if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour are prepared
if not it is merely a question of settling where the be war
if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are like these
if others did not understand him it was so much the worse about and
if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of felt as
if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it something as
if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to friend as
if she did not recognize him smiling as
if she had asked him to do it gravity as

impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then with the
importance of the coming campaign understand the
importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact the sole
importance to make up for this at home pierre had attributed great
importance who had grown old in society and at court he went man of
important considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow by two
important government officials to his table had admitted even

important is happening between them thought something very
important more important than anything he had ever something very

important one was entrusted to dokhturov that same difficult and
important personages of the town this was malvintseva the most
important personages who had to be made ashamed of expected several

important step up in the service and he at once considered an
important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing were most
imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased were being
impossible
impossible
impossible
impossible as such happiness seems i must do strange and
impossible but thats
impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite but its
impossible first because as experience shows that a it was
impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken it was
impossible for the russians to stop this movement to difficult but
impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first thing is
impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at it was
impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter but thats
impossible see what is going on in the yard she mamma its
impossible she did not ask and did not want to know it possible or
impossible to do anything here thought rostov no its
impossible to express all one thinks and that he had after all

impressions such as the retreat from smolensk his visit very serious
improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling began to

in 1812 the french gain a victory near moscow moscow but then
in 1812 went on very much as usual but with this provincial life
in 1812 what reason was there for assuming any moscow based
in a bad temper because prince vasili was coming or whether he was
in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince his being

in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to natasha began
in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and be here
in a minute wait or no no of course go and say oh yes

in harmony
in harness and grows skittish between the shafts he feels himself
in he is asking for you clearer come
in her beauty of which he had heard much well as
in her complexion and especially in the color of her tawny tint
in her continued this man she is everything everything
in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind what is
in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of another and
in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences listeners but
in her life she was at that height of bliss when one ever been
in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and mary and
in her male attire she seemed quite a different person decided and
in her own way proud princess hard and
in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing she sat
in her sisterinlaws room prince andrew in a traveling princess was
in her spiritual treasures
in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself the sobs
in her voice i have had so little happiness in life that eyes and
in here for but i will give her a piece of my mind worming herself
in here the masters are going away and the whole house please come

in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners further strengthened
in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the memory aroused
in him only no 17 of the captured russians arrested and they saw
in his armchair he said le roi de prusse and bending forward
in his bass voice entering the drawing room the gigantic footman
in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning and suddenly
in his career moreover he could see by her manners first steps
in his carriage lay down
in his childhood had often seen at the gate was prince andrew
in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief he lay
in his corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre was asleep
in his dressing gown every day he invariably became the count
in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at her the bedroom
in his eyes noticed tears
in his face went up to pierre and bent over him and sympathy
in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either his mind
in his fatherland now that he seemed to possess liberal innovations
in his feeble voice so high pitched and irresolute and shouting
in his fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the and mildness
in his friends face youthful expression
in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and shuffling along
in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his pierre smiled
in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and he seemed
in his horse and advanced at a walk dolokhov reined
in his horse before the emperor salute reined
in his imagination pierre maintained the contrary and existed only
in his large elongated hand on blue paper as abbreviations wrote
in his mind as the category of those he termed clearly defined
in his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to buttoned up
in his opinion have directed humanity one historian individuals who
in his own garden to his memory and he told everybody that to erect
in his own life is just what makes the choice of occupation given him
in his own thoughts apparently immersed
in his own way understood everything
in his palm she will soon be singing and frolicking about gold coin
in his place thought pierre its even certain that i same thing
in his place waiting everyone was
in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he it proper
in his request to kutuzov arrived at grunth and had persisted
in his riding cloak mounted on a black horse was prince andrew
in his soul a power of life independent of it and strengthened
in his soul he firmly believed in the possibility doubts remained
in his soul in connection with that tree during this pleasant rose
in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the carelessly holding
in his treatment of his daughter to his former found expression
in his turn has offered that as an explanation him and
in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips he laughed
in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the him but
in his voice who invented him if he did not exist and authority
in his way threw himself on the sofa that stood
in his wounded leg gazed with wideopen eyes at this strange the pain
in history of the aim of an historical personage being an instance
in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would given one
in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the lodges or
in imagination andrews face as she remembered it in already saw
in imagination she told this story to him her seducer and tears as
in it a new enjoyment it found
in it an order on a red ribbon napoleon without moment laid
in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything was not
in it by selfsacrifice and heroism were the most useless take part
in it for a window when it was very cold embers from mended glass

in silence from one corner of the room to the other and he went
in silence he finished a couple of bottles of wine by the latter
in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers at him
in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the they halted

in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing pierre was
in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary how readily
in surprise then came the prayer just received from the one another
in that action his participation
in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she daughter and
in that difficulty could help

in that rigid position some time
in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do anything announced
in that wellknown afterdinner mood which more than napoleon was
in the absence of opponents between two councils would a third
in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish andrew besides
in the affair with the commissariat officers on only interested
in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had prince vasili
in the anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a while still
in the army many stories of dolokhovs extraordinary bravery had heard
in the battery where a small number of men busy at their support here
in the battle of vyazma petya had been in a constant state taken part
in the body of the army they did not ask themselves and intriguing

into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh went off
into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not had collapsed
into a huge shock he stood in full view of the audience brushed up
into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a from bursting

into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs sonya burst
into line the masters rode together uncle rostov servants fell
into moscow as blood flows to the heart peasants streamed
into negotiations
into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself should sink
into pierres eyes looked challengingly
into pierres eyes looking straight

into puddles as they crossed a road the misty sky then splashing
into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound would go
into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land after staggering
into sobs i shall die waiting a year its again burst
into sobs in his presence yet sooner or later it had to would burst
into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go out
into step
into tears
into that gloomy study which he had entered with such pierre went
into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a with him
into the back room anatole went
into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence they got
into the components talleyrand chateaubriand alexanders power
into the conservatory with its large bust and full windows opening
into the corridor and met coming out of the door of dolgorukov out
into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the coming out
into the court of count bezukhovs house as the wheels was driving
into the depths of the country was not the result of any of napoleon
into the depths of unknown and undefined misery that could plunge him
into the distance these were troops of beauharnais stretched away
into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom costumes went
into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier loudly went
into the gallery your excellency said the please step
into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning maidservant ran
into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises saying gives it
into the hands of that idiot anatole pained boris and especially
into the heart of russia late in the season without any its advance
into the heart of the country but from their first entry the french
into the hive and they flew out empty now they fly out honey flew
into the house and went on tiptoe through the natasha ran
into the little room where boris slept rostov without they went
into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling then went
into the matter can easily convince himself to look
into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted why ride
into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of he passed
into the officers wards youll see for yourself he youll step
into the open under the sky once more ceiling out
into the open window lighting up the room and part of rays shone
into the past and she began to recover physically gradually faded
into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying pierre glanced
into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and nicholas looked
into the ravine petya rode beside denisov the pulsation their riders
into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian they went
into the redoubt before a thin sallowfaced perspiring man in he run
into the region where the army was already in action and farther
into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse and galloped
into the room had vanished and as if answering a question had brought
into the room he opened the casement the night was this burst
into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is all mingled
into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and she passed
into the sitting room where there was a smell of halfopen door
into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as pausing went
into the town when lunatics command our armies god lunatics out
into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and already descended
into the vestibule went out
into the water or when he challenged a man to a duel dropping them
into the yard she paused to consider where she should go going out
into their conversation either a shade of involuntarily introduced
into their stiff collars and wearing scarves and all necks squeezed
into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed had settled
into view before rostov and the fear of death and stretchers came
into view through the smoke no one paid any attention to enemy came
into which his head had sunk deep and again his the stretcher
into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit european affairs
into whose society pierres wife had thrown her and anatole kuragin
intonation that obliged one to listen to each expression and
introduce himself and without experiencing the least necessary to
introduce my brother to you said helene her eyes shifting let me
introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come whom he
introducing a power which they apparently do not explained by
invalid
invaluable man
invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered commanded an
invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter men are
invitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat obtained an
invitations to denisov almost simultaneously german sent
invitations without exception written in french and all her
invited her to go with them she sat down and played with chairs and
invited nicholas to come to moscow inclination she
invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and his presence
invited to dance she stood with her slender arms having been
inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed expecting and
involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise instance they
involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her going in she sometimes
involuntarily remembered how dolokhov who had fully wife he
involuntarily took a step back from the campfire disguise and
involuntarily waded kneedeep in the bog it and
iogel coming up to nicholas look how many charming young said little
irksome constrained conversation they heard the sound minutes of
ironic smile
irony a fresh one was now added allusions to stepmothers pretexts for
irony as though he was really saying that all desire bitterness and
irony because he thought she was trying what she quiet gentle
irrationally but later on to fit what had involuntarily and
irrefutable consciousness of freedom this unshakable
irregular intervals as before followed by one or two shots at
irreparable there was no insult on either side matters become
irrepressible hatred showed an
irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class obligatory and
irreproachable sincerely despised rogues and bad considered himself
irresistible attraction
irresistible human need for sleep he really was satisfying the
irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all by that
irresistible persuasiveness had an
irresistible youthful childish drowsiness but what succumbing to
irresolute movements hampered his
irritability depression and
irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk state of
irritated
irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward excited and
irritated her it hurt her to think that while she lived most part
irritated prince andrew he knew not why he was delicate hands
irritated the wound interrupting that necessary insult painfully
irritating news than yours could not have been conceived that more
irritation almost morbid
is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i have papa he
is a dear little thing said rostov to ilyin who was she really
is a different one thought princess mary my my vocation
is a fluid volatile spiritual essence christ the bodies mercury
is a fool thats all him he
is a freemason i have found out he is fine darkblue no he
is a god and future life there is truth and good and if there
is a letter to prince vasili and here is money anything here
is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking mind this
is a palace she said to her husband looking around why this
is a rake and all that still i like him so you see i do though he
is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness book it
is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy visitor he
is a source of selfcognition quite apart from this consciousness
is a strong one and while they are marching to go round we occupy
is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow chief he
is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence yes he
is a wise and clever fellow address he
is absolutely true all this
is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee all that
is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you son anatole
is accused of circulating napoleons proclamation it is not if he
is advantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially right it
is afraid continued the first speaker he of the yes one
is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange feet where
is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and ah he
is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voice then he
is all finished he thought and how has it all happened so it
is all i can say friendship that
is all i have to say to you the count is very very badly that
is all over and forever know it
is all the same dolgorukov said quickly and getting oh that
is all the state has for the millions it has spent and that
is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid yes it
is all very well for rostov whose father sends him attractive it
is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow of whom 2 it
is already persuading me forgive it means that i ought if mary
is already time for me to go replied prince andrew gentlemen it
is always losing everything remarked the countess there he
is always said in such cases he thought but something special
is always the case not a single column reached its place at and as
is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul grasp it
is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said yes he
is an angelic being ah boris boris she paused and how her she
is an essential condition anticipated that
is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions if he
is and can be no beginning to any event for one event though there
is and he looked round in the sleigh whatever it
is and how attentive and how he remembers everything he fellow he
is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible it
is anyone in the world to me you alone are sonya what
is anything come back yakov alpatych for christs if there
is as essential to him as much a condition of his physical labor
is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of what it
is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh you here he
is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active fools hippolyte
is at least something to do excuse it
is bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of not grand
is being led is known to the historians to one of them which humanity
is being sent to smolensk asked princess mary and alpatych
is better ask pierre to dine with us he has been to the if he
is better for me to come less often because no because it
is beyond our comprehension ultimate purpose
is budding but though i do not know what causes the cold the oak
is by his wishes which natasha tried to guess their way orders that
is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about now he
is certain is that that girl is so charming so original but what
is certain said the prince then it
is chance what is genius but what
is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a boldly it
is clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it your mind
is closed and the police are leaving the club
is colonel gerard here tell me
is composed of lower grades of the service the rank every army
is connected with and the more power he has over others the people he
is crowned with success the conspiracy
is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on and honest
is dealt with that for history this question does not the question
is dearest to man his own life and it sometimes seems that is what
is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor the snow
is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor thabor bridge
is denisov
is devoted to it entire attention
is different nowadays everything is changed the yes everything
is dishonorable dont you know that i love him screamed say he
is doing something for itself he submissively fulfilled the thinks it
is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have that this
is done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not the same
is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and when this
is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle your position
is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and mistakes he
is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dont understand oh that
is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and precedes it
is dying pierre again began but he
is everything ready asked the count and stroking well vasilich
is everything where she is not and there is all gloom other half
is everywhere twice the marauders even attack our and famine
is explained to us as being due to profound devastated road
is extremely displeased that despite the strict the emperor
is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this ball it
is flattering said the man of profound intellect the doubt
is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall alone love
is god and while there is life there is joy in that movement
is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in well everything
is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange as gold
is golden man can be master of nothing while he fears the unspoken
is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be all that
is good and one sometimes hears that too shifting grain
is grand but kutuzov the man who from the beginning enthusiasm he
is gratitude this is recognition for those who have and this
is great and where the causes of the action are its examination
is hard for me to bear excuse me goodby and every loss
is hard to understand only the following historical movement
is hardly a sufficient reason mamma well that
is harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an the tree
is he asked how
is he ill asked natasha her frightened eyes andrew lying
is he it is my benefactor but he died thought pierre yes that
is he well how
is he yes that man is somehow closely and painfully yes it
is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should family that
is herders theory said prince andrew but it is not yes that
is here come balaga
is here still said prince andrew and prince then she
is his father keeps a cookshop here by the stone bridge fellow he
is his wound what is his general condition but how
is historys slave a king
is holding on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea ship he
is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four whether there
is how component forces equal to one a gave a resulted that
is how do you mean said pierre not being a yes that
is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence and that
is how sorry i am loss kutaysov
is human to err
is illegitimate
is impassable theres a swamp there said the esaul the hollow
is important are the rights of man emancipation important what
is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in that it
is impossible to stop them he reported and it
is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of when it
is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when oh he
is in a very bad humor very morose be prepared ivanovich he
is in a weak state as you know said the old servant but he
is in disfavor now come here if he
is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head the matter
is in napoleons hands the russian army only incalculable wealth
is in your hands dron rejoined sadly the power
is in your hands fate it
is inconceivable exist and
is indeed a darling ill send her to you ah she
is infinite and so in this respect too there can never while time
is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if mill wheel
is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation the peasant
is is this she asked her governess peering into the face and who
is it
is it about she asked what do they matter to you natasha what
is it again said pierre to himself and an there it
is it and why
is it asked natasha what what
is it asked the driver which house
is it but where
is it came a sharp unpleasant voice well what
is it for my own pleasure that i am at the farm or in the our affairs
is it from whom he asked immediately but without well what
is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer willing what
is it i am attached to papa said anatole attached what
is it is so it
is it meant to prove what i ask you about what
is it not too late to administer unction asked the i wonder
is it of yours cried the count what business
is it the doctor from moscow is not here yet said the but how
is it tonight said the mother having arranged her well what
is it true that we have been beaten and what did you i say
is it what is the matter oo oo oo and sonya what
is it whats his name but who
is it you dont see that if the count has written a intelligent how
is it you have so little tact dont you see you are favorite how
is just what i tell him said she i dont understand ah that
is life and what is death what power governs all i what
is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows another which
is lise he asked answering her question only by a and where
is love he thought love what
is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning there he
is madness to buy anything in moscow now though it
is mercy for every sin countess there
is more important than anything whispered princess mary that sleep
is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant a locomotive
is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said our fire
is much more honorable to admit ones mistake than to let count it
is my conviction and judging by the last letter with but that
is my hand on it are you satisfied guards here
is my only reason for being here i came simply to help wishes that
is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists similar belief
is necessary that the first column marches the object it
is neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and purity all
is never to leave you father never to separate my my desire
is no change i only came to have a talk about no there
is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely as there
is no more no more natasha he
is no riding round it now i must look for the reflected there
is no step no crime or petty fraud he commits which in happen there
is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears that there
is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant be your victory
is not a pure doctrine just because it is profligacy illuminism
is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it smile freemasonry
is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she perhaps he
is not at all interesting let us have dinner and however this
is not back yet said sonya no papa
is not being attacked is where there are most provisions when it
is not enough i told them something else is continuing that
is not fit to be my sisters companion woman who
is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing the the wound
is not in hes gone to headquarters said telyanins the master
is not much delighted by your victory even i a poor king francis
is not over at thirtyone prince andrew suddenly decided no life
is not right the world
is not trained but it is a beautiful voice that must be said it
is not true that hes married then it
is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head the prince
is not yet ended the man who ten years before and a year his part
is nothing but quiet and peace thank god exist there
is nothing nothing but that but even it does not sky there
is now in mourning how can one think of it besides she
is now settled and i ought to have been off long ago business here
is of his way of life now that that was so occupation that
is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and it
is on a very low stage of mental development like a are considering
is on this on our side of the river and is prince auersperg
is one of the most essential parts of the machine revolves quietly
is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a if he
is only mademoiselle bourienne society there
is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to yet it
is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to this problem
is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed voice here
is our own kolya dear fellow how he has here he
is own brother to performance i said friday and here a promise
is particularly becoming to her or she really has either black
is past and to feel not exactly dull but sad everything good
is past midnight cannot now be altered said he you have for it
is pathetic they say he cried like a child when the the count
is performed that act
is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to so it
is played out said prince andrew whats the use of my part
is possible to love someone dear to you with manifestations it
is power 1 what
is predetermined from on high depends on the coincidence human events
is probably tired of them said another officer that he
is quite different replied nicholas implying that oh denisov
is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was this reply
is reached after the final war of 1815 alexander possesses the goal
is really melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove if this
is really too late said count orlov looking at the camp oh it
is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks the news
is rich i dont regard myself as a relation of his and your father
is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to no one
is right and what is wrong men always did and always will know what
is right and who is wrong no one but if you are alive despot who
is right thought the old princess all her convictions yes she
is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i dont see everything here
is said boris thinking rostov had said his there he
is selfassured because he regards himself personally a frenchman
is she i should like very much to see her said really where
is she is queen and her word is law as it
is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at his and what
is sin the conception of which arises from the god what
is singing their praises and i dont even know then whole town
is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night happily he
is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a more she
is so kind answered princess mary oh he
is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a your loss
is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the and he
is so you know unpleasant but my intelligence she
is something new ive never seen before this isnt the kosoy no this
is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen said captain there
is stationed between ruza and mozhaysk considerable detachment
is staying in the same house with them his excellency
is still alive and gay and he
is still far away your excellency according to the the enemy
is still needed to justify the final collective act this man
is still on the hill your excellency just where it was the picket
is strange do you suppose i who could think i well this
is submission to god suffering is necessary man simplicity
is such a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend that girl
is suffering physically and mentally and apparently the count
is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that says everybody
is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the that city
is that all he asked well and
is that how you look at it we dont see it like one scoundrel
is that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at all this
is that regarding man as a subject of observation from the problem
is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage whose caleche
is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was own story
is that true that kind
is the battle you have so longed for victory depends soldiers this
is the best expression of the best the eternal was freemasonry
is the best of all if only you did not go away do contrary now
is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove this indication
is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which kind that
is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come here it
is the expression of a consciousness that is not that reply
is the future life the someone is god someone there
is the greatness of the roman spanish or french realm this goal
is the honor of the french infantry so necessary to the at stake
is the matter my dearest why whatever
is the matter sonyas eyes fixed on him seemed to nikolenka what
is the matter with you count you are not like but what
is the matter with you how can you said he sonya what
is the nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is a dinner
is the one handle by means of which the material this conception
is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh yes this
is the only difference between them he said this smiling one that
is the only thing we need fear or he is changing retreating which
is the poor people and the price of commodities an rabble that
is the predestination and inevitability of his every more evident
is the relation of a given person to other individuals in 1 power
is the reward for all those fainthearted men he here she
is the same coalescence into a group of enormous movement there
is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he yes it
is the unconscious general hive life of mankind history that
is the use of that when a third of their army has wretches what
is the will of the people also transferred to international relations
is then accomplished from east to west with a a countermovement
is there in running across it like that said ilagins but what
is there to oblige him to reply write to pierre as prince but what
is there to say about me said pierre his face but what
is there to talk about said pierre its all the no what
is thinking but of thee who still
is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushin then what
is this my fathers health is growing noticeably worse he the case
is this she cried twanging a thick string sonya what
is those who submit to the power but as the moral physically it
is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and here it
is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances and it
is thought the officer and he rode round the whole nuisance it
is time for bed night it
is to be done in these circumstances to favor today what
is to do our duty to fight and not to think thats our business
is to say their commands are often not executed and effect that
is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold them that
is to say under conditions in which it was not merely french that
is to use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in living that
is too bad its witty but unjust said anna pavlovna your joke
is too kind replied de beausset to the invitation to your majesty
is transferred to the convention to the directory to fifty years
is true as they tell me that i cant even go away turn to
is true but by those who had abandoned it and not inhabitants it
is true had latterly spent whole days at home that is in who it
is true it is dreadful how little we dreamed of such a thing we hear
is true or not should make no difference to you whether it
is true prince in our days continued vera mentioning yes that
is true yes it
is unlike herself glad to throw her father over and she tail and
is very good to me we shall have supper count so you coming he
is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it yes he
is very important from general dokhturov said but this
is very interesting but he does not see the thing in that abbe
is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he yes it
is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be no she
is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he her father
is very unfortunate added anna pavlovna deserves she
is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of person who
is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy acting there
is war what is needed for success in warfare what are but what
is was reading or writing in his study pierre had but occupied that
is well for a people who do not as the french did in 1813 and it
is well known where the time between the action and external world
is what made me sorry to part with life that is what understand that
is what the emperor is thought petya no i cant so this
is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked you that
is wicked and heartless there now i like your denisov selfwill he
is with books and lectures and with taking notes learning that
is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we a battle
is worst of all stronger and more repulsive germans selfassurance
is wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i dont evewything here
is written about the berezina on the french side this is and still
is written by learned men and so it is natural and that history
is young because he is poor because he is a because he
is your brotherinlaw now if i may ask he said and where
is your chief temptation do you know it i think you frankly what
is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd what role
is yours she concluded scanning the faces before her is mine
island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and to the
ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles that the
isnt but it
isnt it but above all she is a handsome estimable worth something
isnt it time to begin now in front already far ahead if asking
isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book well now
isnt she dull and ashamed sister why
isnt that lovely and noble yes very noble isnt it be free
iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the he higher
issue orders or was it earlier still when when bennigsen to
issues of false money burglaries incendiarisms thefts forgeries
it a few inches from the corner and then closer in himself pushed
it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not how was
it a holiday added is
it a petition what is
it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of themselves giving
it a very simple thought occurred to him what does it account of
it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger because in
it about and so there was no one cause for that to bring
it about asked nicholas what was
it across helenes back helene stooped forward to snuffbox passing
it advantage of
it ah here are people coming he thought joyfully seeing blood on
it all and again listened to denisov deal with
it all and felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him to escape
it all be done properly according to rule look here put things let
it all looks like war as if regretting a well general
it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between time that
it all right ive invited some of the wounded into the papa is
it all that i ought not to refuse a suppliant and deduced from
it all took place by his will and so the question napoleon that
it always appears that just that event was foreseen whatever happens
it always seems to me like that
it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling found in
it and as the event results from the collective activity wishes about
it and began reading pierre took
it and did not welcome the french with bread and inhabitants abandoned
it and hand it personally to the french emperor when to take
it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy nothing about
it and he patted her cheek it will drive all the youll like
it and i talk about chance i see a force producing effects to know
it and now with their whole army are on this side of bridge cross
it and read
it and shall prove it said rostov i know
it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal sniffed at
it and with a lid and a gold snuffbox with the counts depicted on
it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a something toward
it answered bilibin listen the french entered thats just

it asked kutuzov with a look which when the candle who brought
it asked natasha whats in
it asked pierre what is
it asked someone in the porch who is
it asked the countess startled but seeing by her what is
it asked the person in the other room what is
it at every step recourse to
it at the courtmartial then he turned to pierre do all about
it at the fire and how they had laughed at him while drying
it be bad said denisov well let
it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our army what can
it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply and cant
it be my treasure and prokofy trembling with master can
it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my but could
it be you yourself told him to come its the who should
it beats he took dolokhovs hand and put it on his heart feel how
it became clear to sonya that natasha had some then suddenly
it because you married her answered an inner voice to do
it begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasili then how did
it begun is it time pierre asked waking up what has
it bucks one up laughed the first lucky you thats grand
it but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good spoke of
it but i see it dont notice
it but it is only a trick march on destroy the will ratify
it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting to express
it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not up in
it but the frenchman hastily interrupted him for concealing
it but they they were steady and calm all the time yielded to
it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest nothing for
it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad herself for
it cannot be that there is no answer and i believe exist why
it cant be he thought this stern thin pale face that but no
it cant be he told himself at every look gesture possible no
it cant be helped said he in a tone of vexation and oh well
it cant be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess am no
it chaffingly but without getting angry prince disputed
it clean and burns
it come on yours are worth thousands try yours borzois thats
it completely and leaving the room without crying he understood
it concerned not himself but another his daughter pointed because
it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he what would
it covering his face with his hands fell into
it cried the count opening his moist eyes and yes thats
it dangerous to make a second attack for fear denisov considered
it dear what is
it deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did without probing
it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses ever that
it did he thank us came eager questions from all sides halt is
it did not enter his head that he was in love with natasha fresh air
it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep of life
it did not suit her faded features always played which though
it does not advance by a hairs breadth the solution of necessity but
it does not understand we all profess the christian law who wrote
it dont see
it down and began suddenly flung
it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the conjunction with
it em hot mate they wont make another push now weve given
it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the time
it equally right or wrong is he who says that napoleon prayed for
it especially from the list of prisoners the french and realized
it especially so the general who admired the apartment always has
it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life dress have
it fighting again a woman with a baby and not doesnt see
it for
it for a long time thats it come on ive given havent touched
it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a please get
it for the tenth time molibres words mais que diable had said
it from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the angle to
it from the count she entered the room with resolute will hide
it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was boris that
it general as if id be so bold replied the dont mention
it general he said evidently not doubting that this strange isnt
it god grant it said anna pavlovna god grant
it had been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no at which
it had been decided to advance immediately prince schwartzenberg
it had been discharged and he had not had time to arm besides
it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussischeylau the campaign
it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow suffering as
it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that strongly as
it had taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite now that
it had the commander in chief continued to look at him have sustained
it had to be betokening that
it had to go that is never in the way people devised but them as
it had to happen as there is between those who happened because
it had to occur because it had to millions of men occurrence but
it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was the wood
it happen in this and not in some other way why did
it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now why is
it has begun here it is was seen even on prince the feeling
it have been yesterday when i ordered platov to decided can
it have cost him to hold out for another two days they what would
it have ordered
it he also brought a bottle of kvass taken from the claret in
it he asked what is
it he glanced through it then read it again and then and reading
it he said crossly and his hand shaking what is
it he was sent to hard labor in siberia karataev put
it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing remained with
it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every he considered
it his duty to assure him that he was not french and again thought
it holds it and in combination produces other mercury seizes
it hung that bright comet which was connected in opposite to
it hurts im old and weak and this is what you wanted well hurts me
it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov how is
it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove i believe
it i cant bear it natasha cried and her eyes dont say
it i have several like it said petya blushing please keep
it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she how was
it ill take
it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some somewhere put
it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to consider not wish
it in all his wars she still did not take out grandfather wore
it in him and said that his son would not live particularly liked
it in one direction he tried to get away from them always dragging
it in sight of uncle who is watching from over there and spring at
it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man dont put
it incumbent on him to reply said that from the balashev feeling
it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though she felt
it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you thats just
it involved him in too much expense but still his nobility because
it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing ah madam
it is a society of true conservatives a society of government but
it is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when mary says
it is a turbulent crowd your excellency i hardly treachery but
it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear of course
it is again do you hear said he pointing in the anything there
it is all very clear but when applied to history that be arranged
it is always better to bow too low than not bow low principle that
it is being punished know why
it is count said she isnt it how delightful
it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic i think
it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose and yet
it is disgraceful a stain on our army and as for fourteen hours
it is dull in my house again and she glanced at helene say that
it is easier writing than doing designs laws
it is enough as
it is essential for him to combine his movements with enemys hands
it is essential for us it will give us all we need on you
it is great 2 that
it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked yes but
it is he answered absently thats not the point i of course
it is he seemed to be trying to find the right at ulm
it is horribly stupid said pierre oh yes
it is how little effort it needs to do so much good how easy
it is i have to postpone my return for three months you know but as
it is impossible to go back to the same heartfelt talk
it is impossible to understand all that it is only pride that
it is its as if it were a dream i like that how strange
it is its nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it for that
it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do life as
it is liberty equality and a certain kind of civilization to another
it is my greatest pleasure said natasha its not fair you know
it is natasha suddenly exclaimed about what nonsense
it is necessary to imagine it in the present on the boundary as free
it is nicholas came sonyas voice how light
it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued i did yes but
it is not at all too long said mavra crawling really madam
it is not right darling i know
it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am be worth
it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes make campfires of it and
it is only listen to me for gods sake ask nurse too they i know
it is only then that what is new and good begins while lost but
it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to which feels
it is said there are thieves among the pavlograd fingers when
it is said vera selecting a moment when all were how strange
it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the yes so
it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort whole army
it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow replied and
it is thats how
it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the presupposable that
it is the reason why the life and activity of people marriage today
it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people destroy it
it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till events and
it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you know what
it is to last prince vasili knew this and having economized if
it is very difficult to tell the truth and young what happened
it is very easy to be an interesting man i am an noticed that
it is what more does one need thought he and suddenly how good
it is you dont see the charm of these delicious understand how
it is you must know we will take it at once and show it to all where
it is your excellency he said with a respectful how pleasant
it ive found it he added ive found
it joined the army in the field in the second half of the and when
it just touching it lightly with her lips began kissing
it justly and justice clashed not only with his feelings to answer
it kirilych isnt
it lagging behind
it late why is
it left much of
it less for
it lets have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging ill drink
it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming teeth but
it long at
it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then dwell on
it loud coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued been pushing
it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the grew angry
it may be a mistake thought the old commander in before then
it may be ill tell them all to hold their tongues and hard as
it mean what is it whom are they firing at who is what does
it might be and he glanced round at the pool from however dirty
it might be for the french to blame rostopchins however tempting
it might be some caprice of a sick and halfcrazy man could tell
it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the princess that
it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon wagon but
it money made of metal that has not the specific substitute for
it moscow was burned because it found itself in a responsible for
it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that her that
it must be and she slammed the casement then if
it must be brought to a head the day after tomorrow heart but
it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is or later
it must be here somewhere said lavrushka and yourselves
it my dear come lets sit down here said she what is
it my dear fellow you see its hurrah for the tsar thats just
it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the i deem
it natasha said princess mary what is
it natasha shared this as she did all his feelings which speak of
it necessary to show his manly superiority over longer considered
it necessary to tell natasha of prince andrews wound and reason found
it next day november 15 after dinner he again went to because of
it nicholas what is
it not for that and remembering his former tenderness yes were
it noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of neither was
it now
it now rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in to doubt
it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading concern was
it of which she herself had no conception meaning in
it off do you promise never take
it on the back and then on the palm then again turned her kissed
it on the ground he flung
it only were so said prince andrew however it is yes if
it originated
it others see things and i dont she said you sit down why is
it out for you in a minute said timokhin and well clear
it out no fear theyll put
it particular about
it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she attention as
it passed unnoticed dinner where
it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him based upon
it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a to achieve
it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces how is
it possible that all is really ended asked pierre but is
it possible that not one of all these men will notice me dance is
it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him in is
it presentation of
it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed father did
it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts once again
it ran
it reaches rich pastures so did the army disperse all over soon as
it really seemed that sonya did not feel her natashas explanation
it really was pink cried natasha who now thought she yes yes
it rests and which no human power can destroy is the on which
it right prince andrews voice trembled and he turned away to make
it rose and fell with stupid simplicity but anything else
it rostov felt as he had done when approaching his on approaching
it said prince andrew sarcastically well and hows they stop
it said rostov evidently thinking of something else oh thats
it said the countess anything about
it said the officer turning to his companion burdino isnt
it said the voice of a man stumbling over something devil take
it said the voice of the man who was stretching himself always hide
it sank in to make quite sure of the firmness the ground foot down
it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle did army when
it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose doctor said
it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of how joyful
it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and smooth that
it seemed to countess mary that he did it on apparent cheerfulness
it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery but at now now
it seemed to her that god heard her prayer happiness and
it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than door and
it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion bad humor
it seems has chastened me only i am sorry for my old says god
it seems to everyone in such cases that it was merely some him as
it seems to him directed his past activity justify his which as
it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading cannot grasp
it seems to me that animal happiness is the only needs while
it set off with ilyin in the lessening rain and the right through
it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my be arranged
it she began as usual in french settling down briskly how is
it she believed it could be but did not understand it anything like
it she felt something like a fresh breeze afterward described
it she has not pride enough to see it if she has no pride how is
it she read this in tikhons face and in that of prince thought about
it should be arranged as
it should be blown up when he left moscow as a child wish that
it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and well have
it so much the better what of
it some new relics asked prince andrew what is
it still worse said nesvitski but sit down and were getting
it stood carriages without horses and things were being front of
it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the our eyes
it suffer for
it surprised at
it that dreadful
it that he had given his word and bound himself forever burden of
it that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose think about
it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but saw where is
it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war how is
it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no how is
it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than how was
it that way thats the trouble dont see
it that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need how is
it thats just what i said to him put in nicholas yes thats
it the death of prince andrew natashas despair petyas flight from
it the kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness qualifications for
it the man sent there was this same irresolute and directed against
it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under rest upon
it the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everything for
it the orders were not to let them in so were in force best of
it then change it purify thyself and as thou art thou hatest
it then you know that there is a there and there is a well thats
it there are thousands such as i in russia has left
it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the believing in
it things are nice as it is she said to herself and she much of
it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of cast upon
it through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something side of
it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave occasion for
it to different parts of his breast as if trying to began pressing
it to drop
it to her and though the gods folk who came to see conception of
it to her now speaking of
it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies id give
it to his nose and greedily sniffed at it snuffbox lifted
it to karataev but give me the pieces that are over and gave
it to likhachev then he flourished the saber tested it and and gave
it to russians to make an idol of this useless old man but he left
it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little and fastened
it to the waiter eyebrows gave
it tonight but i have to tell you what is
it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that mary else but
it true bath isnt
it true natasha asked looking attentively into pierres why is
it true that its peace and capitulation asked well is
it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches pierre is
it turned uselessly in the same place and again
it under him and put
it up
it up and immediately set to work on the other leg carefully coiled
it up and went to her room to pack her own things at soon gave
it up began putting
it up i dare say youre very smart one of them you picked
it up tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself could throw
it used to on the contrary it tormented her more than satisfaction as
it wanted
it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a gone before
it was a great saints day he returned to dinner morrow because
it was a little better than at ulm boasting that
it was all absolutely necessary halfway up the concluded that
it was all over but he said in an indifferent tone understood that
it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere so that
it was already five minutes to ten and the girls were oclock but
it was around him that the people chiefly crowded to himself
it was as if all the powers of his soul were turning flexibly
it was best to be silent but after a while just as a jury and so
it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natasha discussing whether
it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest the room
it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench andrew lay
it was death and prince andrew died entered and
it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the hare but
it was everywhere else just as
it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at brilliant light
it was evident that where they had expected to meet a these reports
it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits in comfort
it was expressed a sense of his own superiority affectionate as
it was far to the kremlin the porter listening in asked if
it was felt that everything would suddenly break their belongings
it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand see whether
it was for me to see her again i have settled on the upper how hard
it was for sonya she watched her friend and did not let her hard as
it was for when evening came no carts had been provided and so
it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns mount before
it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and pierre that
it was impossible not to retreat another and a third days same way
it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye battery but
it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and realizing that
it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was natasha stopped
it was in danger it was said that smolensk had army because
it was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had only son
it was in sonyas place sat natasha who had just come in and so
it was just the crossing of the berezina that insisted that
it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is all yes
it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the difference that
it was madness to leave a height which commanded the saying that
it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided but whether
it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor state but
it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of for him
it was no one felt that
it was not at all the time for tea samovar though
it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an and that
it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only soul no
it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince natasha knew
it was not properly cleaned turned as loosely as countess when
it was not what he was saying that pleased her that her husband
it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him he knew himself that
it was plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the wood
it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of irritable and
it was quite unknown what character the war would take some long as
it was right and that
it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia nodded as
it was that of the legion dhonneur the monarch came out not know
it was the eldest who was reading the one who had met read aloud
it was the memory of a distant past then he recounted captain though
it was the real living natasha and he was not surprised realized that
it was the serf who especially attracted his different branches
it was the third time that day that with an ecstatic smiling sweetly
it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet strange as
it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a and though
it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go and as
it was unbuttoned still seemed to pinch his neck those which though
it was whispered the youth and inexperience of the incapacity and
it was worth while going to certain death as now then only when
it was written though not in german this austerlitz dispositions
it well what have you proved what does this duel you believed
it well with thee he asked from time to time sonya is
it were a flail as if
it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew even if
it were lightheartedly and as
it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made having as
it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment what is
it what has happened what is
it what is
it what is it he asked but his comrade was already what is
it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government be
it what was
it what was that terror i felt of him what is this what is
it whats the matter what is
it where said pierre where is
it which is your house he asked which is
it who is it what is it for he kept asking what is
it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that the better
it will be a tremendous banquet blow over
it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday today and
it will certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those know but
it will do more than if you paralyze it by defend itself
it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask prince andrew
it will serve her right she will be confused but you gods folk
it will turn out badly he said shaking his head eh dron
it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young i bestow
it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said the may recall
it without me called natasha you wont do it right dont do
it wont be you but i wholl suffer leave me your business
it wont donot that but as a friend i shall nice but
it word of
it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment thought is
it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with say is
it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the considered that
it would be and taking her hand he kissed it how good
it would be best to appeal to that general she continued i think
it would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live he thought
it would be impossible to walk on them but when campfire thought
it would be splendid but it will never come about very likely
it would be stolen everything in
it would come about he did not know but he felt sure it arcola how
it would have been impossible to treat her with more person pierre
it would not be enough how much told you
it would not be proper for her in her deep mourning to aunt that
it would not have been much stimulated by it for what had did see
it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing count is
it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to man to why is
it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said he what is
it you are on foot and where are you going please how is
it you cousin ah is

knew that the time of its destruction was near when the though it
knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to of the vicomte
knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the earth but
knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its pierre well

looked at vera and paused the countess pressed her anna mikhaylovna
looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion her legs
looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what the lad
looked down the field across which vehicles and pierre first
looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been vivat and
looked excited and worried faces all
looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and the assistant
looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was emperor who

looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man with the mason
looked intently into boris eyes and sighed berg again rostov
looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said he paused
looked joyfully and proudly around while bagration spoke to count ilya
looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and prince andrew
looked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and men who
looked more closely at the ring with its skull a masonic hands he
looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun attention he
looked observantly and sympathetically at the respectful expression
looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped prince andrew
looked questioningly at the princess but could not prince vasili
looked round and meeting the counts eyes nodded to him and the lady
looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized quickly pierre
looked round saw little andrew following her felt countess mary
looked round several times at her daughters softened the countess
looked round trying by a smile to win simons punished schoolboy
looked round with a blush it seemed to him anything reprehensible
looked round with his shortsighted eyes without pierre perplexed

looked smart and well kept horses all
looked sternly and gloomily at the audience mademoiselle george
looked sternly at her and an expression of anger prince andrew
looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel nicholas and
looked straight before her all that night she did not eyes she
looked to the right and saw something running toward him again he
looked toward the door which creaked as the second everyone again

looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and people and
looking at the man he was addressing and did indistinctly without
looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant they avoided
looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing songs and
looking at wolzogen gave directions for the kutuzov without
looking black on one side and with a silvery light on pollard trees
looking boris in the face shouted not
looking carelessly about him up and
looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the dense mass
looking for someone who would put this man back in glanced round
looking glasses
looking into princess marys eyes pierre was
looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so head and
looking like something between a cart a cabriolet materials and
looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy he was
looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode rostov still
looking straight before him with a smile that did not dolokhov and
looking straight in front of him listened in silence prince andrew
looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but he kept
looking uneasily and timidly at her eyebrows and
looking up at her and listening to the sound of her but occasionally
looking up from under a sable hood was still sitting beaming eyes
looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure who was

moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush for a
moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre at the
moment the door opened at that
moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all but the
moment the first smith got up and scratching his bruised at that
moment the flames flared up and showed his young masters at that
moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and in a
moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different at that
moment these men might have been seized with horror at what at any
moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps at that
moment they heard through the darkness the challenge qui that very
moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with from the
moment this news had only one significance for both of them at that
moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song at a
moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road at the
moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with at the
moment with a sinking heart and then immediately starting to for a
moment with noiseless footsteps and with the at that
moment with soft steps the countess came in shyly in at that
moment zhilinskis voice was heard calling boris at that
moments he had lived through at the executions had as those dreadful
moments of antagonism occasionally and it was always had their
moments princess mary would think how intellectual work at such
moments silence natasha answered yes ill after a
moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in at such
moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome fully the rare
mon cher she then said holding out her hand to very pleased
mon dieu oh she heard as she left the room mon dieu
mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one mon dieu
mon pere no merci

monetary affairs had not improved during the two the rostovs
money and all things necessary for the uniform and the count
money and dolokhov and anger and honor its all misery and
money difficulties had told nicholas that this was all speaking of
money for your journey you require
money forward he prepared to deal rostov sat down by his moving the
money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should marrying for
money in circulation paper money and coin the biographies is like
money nor the time like prince galitsyn to engage a neither the
money on the cards or i may get muddled in the reckoning place your
money under the guise of loans gave him
money which he had prepared raising the use of forged russian
monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags with hugh
monotonous sound of weyrothers voice ceased kutuzov when the

monsieur le prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and pray god
month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were him a
month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half within a
month had recently died in the rostovs house at yaroslavl and than a
month passed in quiet surroundings she felt more and more after a
month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and during the
months
months
monuments and tradition of that period encounters the
mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely the same
mood he then was this was not even unpleasant to him in the
mood in which everything seems possible and everything that happy
mood of the hostess and then amused himself with the melancholy
mood of their officers after the inspection infected the cheerful
mood reigned in the city everyone believed the joyously festive
moon nearly at its full in a pale almost starless spring shone the
moonlight in the
moral nausea but what on earth is worrying me he feeling of
moral responsibilities from their path clear mens
morals a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest very worst
morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were divisions of
morands and gdrards divisions for whose movements no heights as
more a position than any other spot one might find in the was no
more advantageous to live in the counts house than preferable and
more and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had more and
more and began proving to pierre that there was no brows still
more and he shouted fool he was greatly depressed from was no
more and i should have understood it all but what am i one second
more and more clearly distinguished his form and her as she
more and more denuded by russian troops moving down the were being
more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he face brightening
more animated and evidently wishing to express his new more and
more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his kutuzov was
more beautiful than it had been three days before at the was even
more charming in society ah here she is yes she is still no one
more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and back again
more confident was the appearance of our troops the lines the
more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if free the
more cried natasha at the door as soon as the more please
more croaked napoleon frowning let them have it they want
more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under well one
more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if rush out
more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping brighter and
more entered into the definite conditions of this having once
more excited by the danger of being crushed he rushed at and still
more firm and resolute sounded still
more firmly at the danger continued while steadily closing up
more frequent complaints from his mother that their from home
more frequently a general does nothing but command the commands still
more frequently in the foot guards then just think what occur much
more frequently toward her and broke off in what he looked round
more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostovs had become
more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe and the
more he tried to conceal its effects the surroundings acutely the
more impatient the nearer they got to moscow more and
more important he paused than to have a good sleep is nothing
more important nearer to the honored guest as importance the
more independent of that position in which he found future the
more inevitability the less freedom and the
more intimidate him than rostovs or a sergeant majors with could no
more lively and he chatted incessantly all through captain still
more manly and looking fresh rosy and boris grown
more manlylooking but what amazed and estranged pierre paler and
more merrily than on the previous night denisov resounded even
more napoleon raised his voice increased the
more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov by a
more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the flank still
more of the general sorrow one still
more of you to come there many
more passed by the old man was living as a convict years or
more please more whats he saying to him
more rapidly back to smolensk beyond smolensk beyond fled still
more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew just once
more said napoleon in a hoarse voice they want
more said no
more serious and stern grew sonyas became the
more she began to tell of how at potsdam the impious say no
more so recently since in the new reigns of paul and character but
more soldiers and now and then women ammunition carts
more solemn and important air than formerly he was so assumed a
more stupid than that could have been devised or more road nothing
more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she sonya was
more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe not any
more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and out any
more than all her other children and even reproached her firstborn
more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made him that
more than half the ladies already had partners and diligently named
more than he could pay had lost
more than once he had driven them through the town when pursued
more than once in paris and tells me he never met present emperor
more than sweet looked at him from those attentive forgotten and
more than the dying soldier and he rode away apparently suffering
more than twenty sat down to table every day these were people and
more this person expresses opinions predictions and which the
more those past interests were closed to him it was as if eagerly the
more to enjoy that dissipation he was so passionately once
more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship this poetic to be
more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had was only
more which he had perhaps left untold pierre understand something
more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had that brothers
moreorderers had really been at their village but that that some
moreover everybody knew vaguely of natashas general attention
moreover speranski either because he appreciated the understand him
mori said these glances pitied memento

moscovites who took their opinions from others ilya rostov and the
moscow
moscow a stampede which made possible what kutuzov after leaving
moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions and ancient capital
moscow after her meeting with rostov princess mary on reaching
moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa napoleon enters
moscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew entirely in
moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had come from
moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of supplies in
moscow and i promise you i will see to it that there estate near
moscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgel attitude in
moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in was in
moscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french arrived from
moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that spies in
moscow and so on people accustomed to think in that road abandoning
moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but wealth of
moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks french reached
moscow and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so ago in
moscow because he wanted to and perished because alexander went to
moscow before noon entry into
moscow by durosnels order to put a stop to the pillage streets of
moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the occupation of
moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who burning of
moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible the suburb
moscow either today or tomorrow morning with her nephew estate near
moscow estate near
moscow for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh inert in
moscow four days previously that same evening a house serf had left
moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is to please
moscow gossips said dolokhov and he took up the oh those
moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled had left
moscow he asked on to
moscow he asked there in
moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the love of
moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner hospitable in
moscow inhabitants of
moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are true that
moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an petersburg to
moscow just reached
moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as all the
moscow letters from
moscow long since meeting in
moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as insisting that
moscow nobody came to the count any more for moving through
moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling neither in
moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the to defend
moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger abandonment of
moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with there in
moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile favorite in
moscow the effect natasha had on him made him hasten to came to
moscow the rostovs belonged to the best society without though in
moscow the soldiers took with them everything they fleeing from
moscow the story told about him at count rostovs was true sent to
moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after and in
moscow there was little talk or thought of moscow retired beyond
moscow they meant to leave for the country long ago long in
moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchin away from
moscow to her saratov estate with a vague jesters from
moscow wait for me ruin of
moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of to defend
moscow what a chance those girls have missed your peasants is in
moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned home in
moscow which had just been printed the last army orders appeal to
moscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback doctor from
moscow without a battle though moscow was then already not abandon
moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly to leave
moscow would not be given up and thereby ruined believing that
moscow yesterday do you know that she has lost her arrived in
moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic will see
moses the victory over amalek gideon over midian and thou gavest
moskva and yauza bridges the stone
moskva river is and we have thrown up three redoubts there where the
moskva rivers was broken and hilly between the hollows kolocha and

most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders but the
most contradictory rumors were current in the town some strangest and
most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating easiest and
most diverse characters and social positions on the faces young of

most of the gentry were strolling about the room emperor but
most of the prussian fortresses had been received when surrender of

near the watchmans hut in the forest and told the place arranged

nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and having gone
nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when the it was

necessary
necessary for a divorce which would be explained to the formalities
necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the it was
necessary his income would be reduced by three fourths but he it was
necessary not to allow the troops to loot to prepare steps were
necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been when the
necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his is therefore
necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save it was
necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the considered it
necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the considering it
necessary was absolutely
necessities of life the french did not need to be informed in the
necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed a political
necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow that the
necessity of replying but as a man he shrank before the felt the
neck
neck and applied his foot and knee to him behind with great of the
neck and his head that had been half shaved was again long thin
neck and looked pale and ill he had been feverish for two round his
neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his thin
neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear and long thin
neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing and the from her
neck they spoke of most ordinary things yet she felt that on the
neck turned his long neck twice this way and that sighed chafed his
necklaces and gold embroidery who was bracelets plunies

need not have said them he thought and then nothing them i
need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a that pierre
need only discard the study of the reports and general plans yet one
need to talk he receives his orders and will marry theres no
need you do it said princess mary why did you come now why
needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the head what was
needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though handkerchief she
needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from he is
needed his fathers consent to his marriage and to prince andrew
needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale evidently natasha
needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with what was
needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he seven he
needed which he did not possess jurisprudence was
needing any compulsion to induce them to expose french without
needs no violence because wisdom
needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been danger she

no betrothed i have refused him cried natasha i have
no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many that is
no but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he done so
no chance to talk with you prince during the animated i had
no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for boris received
no clear idea of the cause of rain say according peasants having
no connection with the matter in hand his haggard face which had
no corner of it hidden from him she felt that her unity soul leaving
no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any it needs
no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin there are
no further
no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an anatole is
no getting them together the army should push on before the there is
no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his no good
no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a youth is
no horses could be had even for the carriages much less seemed that
no i know you will pray over it well pray if you like but yes or
no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are you have
no idea that the village he was entering was the property rostov had
no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servants there was
no less astounding than it was in egypt in italy in time was
no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red then with
no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his pierre was
no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through it was
no longer be averted but was taking its course begun could
no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the she was
no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas resumed and
no longer need our aid said kutuzov victory and
no longer presented itself that terrible question tormented him
no longer saw either our own or the enemys fires but trot he
no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of time he
no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it zeal it
no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he could he
no longer thinking of what had occurred but sokolniki field
no look no twitch of a muscle in his face nor a pierres voice
no matter abroad no one will know anything about it is valid
no matter dagger will do he said to himself though reload it
no meaning for anyone else but gave him some of the best which had
no means ready for the impending action from privates to were by
no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks yes and
no money with me he said i have
no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a he said
no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without boris said
no more he is
no more prince andrew looked closely into those they said
no more sorrow or sighing but eternal joy and bliss there is
no more than the others what his words meant during his he knew
no more the frenchman also stopped and took aim rostov could run
no my dear fellow no conditions better than our smallest detail
no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the there was
no need to say more julies face shone with triumph and there was
no nonsense look here
no nothing
no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each minutes taking
no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions countess let
no one and despite his smart guardsmans uniform all these he knew
no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most plan for
no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love natasha loved
no one but the emperor of russia has that right and that
no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying and firmness
no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment time and
no one continued julie to the young man without heeding you spare
no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a rode it
no one could understand it she loved and knew prince affairs that
no one else at that time the two famous decrees were being day and
no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue could be
no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation was true
no one has been more courted than she she went on but i think
no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist there is
no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone strangers with
no one is to interfere with his arrangements leads stipulates that
no one knew anything of the general position of bagrations detachment
no one knew till after eight oclock of mist
no one should notice it while maintaining as martial an air so that
no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of the room
no one to fall in love with on campaign hes fallen as theres
no one to help her and they do cheat her so thing has
no one was to be allowed to leave the city others on the said that
no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that he tomorrow that
no order to advance had been received reported that
no part in the conversation which again became general the alone took
no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties he had
no pleasure was here and they met every week like the old gave her
no really have you anything against me he asked pierre upset you
no reply and bowed and bowed his head in silence balashev made
no reply conversation gave

no said the woman they left in the morning the anferovs
no sense in anything i thought i was really serving my there is
no she is simply enchanting and that is all clever oh
no signs of secrecy or shame on the contrary with she show
no small matter was happening but an important and solemn felt that
no small part of his thoughts sex occupied
no the french were running after them but not daring to whether or
no they will take it their own way they wont understand mary but
no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your he had
no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or he had
no time to realize who these men were he saw the senior he had
no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from there was
no use to anyone now of
no victory but from all sides came the same news of was there
no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a have been
no warmly rejoined prince vasili who would not now yield oh no
no way binding might give time for part of the transport to were in
no we mustnt forget suvorov and his rule not to put our hands
no when your father writes to tell me that you are no no
no wind as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the there was
no worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if make things
no you go and blurt it all straight out before the advice but
no you mustnt think i quite understand no gentlemen
nobleman of the old russian type his purse was heedless genial
nobles every face expressed respectful awestruck lines of
nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in all these
noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble perform the
nobody else in the room addressed pierre there was
nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the with a
nodded affirmatively and natasha at the rapid pace at the count
nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to the englishman
nodded her head weeping princess mary
nodded him he
nodded to the traveler and de beausset had to mount but napoleon
nodded to them he liked to see new faces orderly and
nodding to right and left as casually and goodnaturedly crowd and
noise at the door to attract his attention but pierre did a slight
noise constitute the most essential part of the machine clatter or
noise or display that rostov could not believe his warning or
noise the sound of their old voices saying one after the preceding
noiselessly
noisily about the house and yard shouting and disputing servants ran
noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove others moved
noisy but the different companies did not get mixed hurried and
noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered shoulders and
nom de dieu2 princess mary repeated andrew au
nominated him and was the rhetor a strange feeling admitted i
noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform a french
none
none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others he had
none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not she had
none of the practical persistence that would have enabled pierre had
none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any knew that
none whatever said dolokhov to denisov who on no apologies
nonsense
nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious enough what
nonsense all rubbish those discussions which lead to its all
nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a oh nonsense
nonsense cried marya dmitrievna dont talk
nonsense cried natasha laughing i dont think about oh what
nonsense dessalles that fool said something talked some
nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large sit down
nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife but what
nonsense i only
nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices its all
nonsense kutuzovs expression grew more and more talking absolute
nonsense papa fedya obolenski is younger than i and its not
nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd will they give why talk
nonsense say what you want why talk
nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinshin standing to the
noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostovs and but at
nor a commander in chief but a father if you want anything a prince
nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen neither pierre
nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had longer his
nor even by a combination of the two as intellectual activity
nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted the opera
nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace fall asleep
nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him neither i
nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when neither citizens
nor the burned ruins of moscow all that he now hurrying away
nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the neither bennigsen
nor you neither her
nose
nose and mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was head his
nose and tears dimmed his eyes the sick man was turned on in his
nose arakcheev turned his head toward him without overhanging red
nose as he ran past the men at work holding his
nose before his
nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where captain his
nose his face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and of his
nostrils and kissing it sniffing its
not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew it was
not a diplomatist thats why i joined the hussars thinking that i am
not a fictitious but a live character who like every man europe and
not a fool replied natasha indignantly and seriously no hes
not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he was
not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the war and
not a gray hair in his beard or on his head and his whole there was
not a hair of mans head can fall whose care
not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied there was
not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had was now
not a trace of you remain here off let
not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary mind does
not admit anyone a maid came to the door to say that alpatych and did
not advance
not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment death did
not afraid answered sonyas voice and along the path toward i am
not afterwards remember how he went whether it was pierre could
not against it youve filled your belly thats it
not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to he did
not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him pierre did
not alter the inevitable course of events and that council could
not always old but this is what ill do natasha ill have he was
not and cannot believe this he does
not and did not desire war he continued but it has i do
not and did not wish to break this silence pierre could
not and never will know it and now it will never never be he did
not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said bolkonski was
not answer and left rostopchins room more sullen and pierre did
not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh they did
not answer but looked cordially into the frenchmans pierre did
not answer but smiled uncle did
not answer but winked instead daniel did
not answer can something bad have happened to me he and could
not answer her questions natasha did
not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would pierre did
not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his however did
not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot dolokhov did
not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of and did
not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but i think
not answering humanitys essential question serve as of culture
not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced recalled did
not arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and which did
not arrive till the thirtieth belongings did
not as he had done before but really well and by being a by serving
not as the results of free transferences of the these historians
not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife are you
not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a he did
not asked the princess but why
not asleep you are
not at all as it really was rostov was a truthful young man well but
not at all expecting so loud a report pierre shown fired
not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make your oh no
not at all said boris but if you are tired come and oh no
not at all surprised at this question he understood pierre was
not at all the thing he said what sort of polish this is
not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to yours is
not at all too young replied the count why our oh no
not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify it is
not at all what you suppose but that is what the german it is
not at that moment marching with the company the hussar who were
not available besides as a result of the frequent scouting was
not aware of the fact you are
not bagration have we
not be at peace till you promise me this i shall
not be aware of his happiness he pitied them with his people might
not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token let us
not be delivered in time if news was received one obtained could
not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones and i should
not be done because the flagging spirit of the troops it could
not be missed the rostovs moscow house had not been moscow could
not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow it would
not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael there would
not bear her look but turned away with a sob father could
not bear to remain inactive and has left the enthusiasm could
not become vehement but almost always did become himself and
not been able to explain the details of how metivier and feller had he
not been assured that this was absolutely necessary had she
not been dismissed from here therefore you can stay and and have
not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what body had
not been playing schoolboy twicks wostov youve
not been so goodlooking and had his handsome face not worn had he
not been supplied to the extent forage has
not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his there had
not been to see all this time because i have been at my i have
not begin the engagement he did
not being a husband to his wife and secondly by not allowing first by
not being farther pursued began to recover the french
not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap take things
not blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than path was
not bound together he thought repeating words of weather are
not break away from her and that though it would be a he could
not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow who did
not but i always stick to mother truth its not right offense or
not by another question or by a reply to the former now replaced
not care for society in general but prized the more the natasha did
not carry the weapon in his hand through the certainly could
not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried guilty of
not catch what they were saying but knew they were pierre did
not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by and is
not cease chattering goodnaturedly and gaily continually she did
not change her position but her whole body heaved natasha did
not cheerful in the rostovs home things were
not christians but they too have souls its what the old they were
not come he was alone now except for a soldier who was doctor had
not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary i did
not confirmed either by reason or by experience supposition is
not connected with the execution of the princes limit everything
not considered it right to conceal from your serene highness i have
not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in sonya could
not continue long that a catastrophe was coming which in could
not correspond to the course of events in the first case commands did
not dare to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who detachments did
not dead its impossible she told herself and no hes
not deceived her that that state of freedom and readiness time had
not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of he had
not desire war and had no relations with england alexander did
not deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what numbers did
not did not wish to believe that he could
not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more we are
not disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the moscow did
not disfigured by the approach of death it was the expression was
not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court i do
not do so at once but continued to advance along the balashev did
not do that the people only gave him power that he he could
not dogs
not doing justice to our feelings we forget him fear of
not doing this on my own account she continued i do it i am
not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness why weve
not done because poniatowski advancing on the village and was
not done since childhood he had
not done this having in theory rejected the view held history has
not drag her away at once but sang with her for a long they did
not draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from her she he did
not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the he did
not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed pierre had
not enter she could
not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of evidently does
not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before he did
not even feel animosity toward them french do
not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he he did
not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to nicholas did
not even seem to see me or if they do they look as if they they do
not even that but even were they ten thousand thats more and
not even think or find time to think but only talked nothing did
not evince the least surprise at seeing them there and did
not exhausted by the first the second or any of the processes bee is
not exist
not exist for her evidently did
not exist for the countess her sons growth toward manhood did
not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and i did
not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when i did
not explain to himself what these new relations were he did
not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had he did
not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight rostov was
not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very was it
not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or they did
not feeling his former agility and boldness and under that hint
not fighting pour le roi de prusse but for right we are
not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the pierre did
not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance he did
not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left he did
not finish and ran out of the room he could
not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile he did
not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he he did
not finish just then there was a whistle in the air he did
not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the he did
not finish what he wished to say he did
not finished the last verse before the young people began he had
not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a war does
not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk natasha did
not for a few hours only as in a battle but for discipline fails
not for a moment have failed to recognize her he could
not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it have i
not forgetting anyone i always said when he was remembered everybody
not forgiving the penitent freemasonry by
not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her i have
not get in or out but went on turning uselessly in the screw could
not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a you did
not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in she could
not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one would i
not give up the command of the army to general victory does
not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us equation does
not given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning battle were
not go on he gulped and turned away pierre could
not go to any large gatherings but only to small pregnant did
not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the nicholas did
not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed to i am
not gone to bed yet what do you think mind now then theyve
not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more she could
not greeting anyone the young ladies there to the portmanteaus and
not grow more serious but on the contrary became even situation did
not had a moment free since early morning and had not natasha had
not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of i should
not have done more said napoleon growing more and great could
not have read the letter as she did not even know it had she could
not have said that to me father said the son with a you need
not having the least conception that it could be her companions
not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited him for
not he how can you talk such nonsense no its

not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nicholas did
not hear of remaining in moscow and only awaited the nicholas would
not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she she had
not hed better not cwoss my path id kill him illness or

not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful he he will
not his he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find it were
not if youre not afraid well why
not improve natasha and nicholas often noticed their affairs did
not in a normal state in that respect all the powers of mind was
not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if i am
not in the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on man and
not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry heart was
not in very good condition and instantly the squares greatcoats were
not inquire
not insert them in his letter to napoleon because alexander did
not insist further he had managed people for a long alpatych did
not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that god did
not intend to devote her life to serving prince country did
not interest and did not even exist for alpatych orders did
not it thats tomorrow oh yes natasha sabretache no thats
not jesting bilibin went on nothing is truer or sadder i am

not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke french could
not killed which he very likely would be and found messenger were
not know and would not have believed it but beneath the she did
not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he he did
not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukov others do
not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all petya did
not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted rostov did
not know pierre did
not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor davout did
not know that the brick buildings built to plan were being he did
not know that these troops were not as bennigsen pierre did
not know their meaning but must keep them the second pierre could
not know what to say he did

not knowing in what company he was for napoleons the cossack
not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he the bridge
not knowing what to say shook her head the visitor
not known it i should not have addressed you your view of i had
not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet had he
not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen which did
not leave me it seemed to me that his object in entering him did
not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and sonya was
not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her she did
not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to natasha did
not let him go he sat down sank into thought closed prince did
not let him go she would
not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me soldier did
not like natasha she thought her too fashionably dressed mary did
not like riding and always went on foot never lagging tikhon did
not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did he did
not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish natasha did
not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes rostov did
not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to he could
not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions he could
not look like a common man said the interpreter after he does
not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned pierre did
not lose sight of the essential connection of historical and do
not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained murat had
not make out distinctly what was in that tent the andrew could
not make out what it was all about and still less what pierre could
not managed to present at the right moment though she had after all
not marry for he was married already said pierre he could
not marry he is married he could
not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the zoology was
not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer wintzingerode was
not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when they had
not mistaken thought countess mary why is he cross then im
not more than two hundred rubles every four months even should get
not move it he smashed a pane but could
not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now fellow was
not much to be amused at here said rostov and rode no theres
not my dear why shouldnt i i like him he is kind he no why

not notice the killed and wounded though many fell near him time did
not noticing his visitors sarcastic smile he added
not now occur to him to think of russia or the war or it did
not now say those former terrible words to him but looked she did
not of course
not of course
not of the military regulations or of the arrangement thinking of
not offensive to his master nicholas knew that this daniel scorn was
not on my honor but how is petya i could
not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or in which
not one fell close by they all flew over alpatych incessantly but
not one of the orders in the disposition was or could napoleon so
not one of them wished to or evidently could have done examined him
not one of these was or could be carried out different orders
not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they he was
not one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these before him
not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but on lovely that
not only excluded her from his room but did not admit old prince
not only for what he wrote but also for his skill in were valued
not only held the field but had repulsed the french fight had
not only her look but her exclamations and the brief he described
not only left her hair as it was but did not even look request she
not only made a strong impression but created this speech
not only might but should have gone up to the he might
not only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to and loving
not only saw no need of any other or better husband but as and she
not only the elegant pomaded officers but every their decorations
not only the french but all europe except england which does all men
not only the generals in full parade uniforms appointed position
not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to around him
not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have the first
not order it to be sold prince did
not overtake him so quickly borzois did
not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor has i am
not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew i am
not playing boston a card game he was very fond of occupation when
not possible he cried aloud no its
not possibly be and so did not deliver the order they could
not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little that was
not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was topics did
not pull it away and left off crying natasha not sonya did
not pushing him at all who was
not quite in the right you were impetuous not right
not quite well shes in her room and would like to natasha is
not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure they were
not receive these envoys and did not reply to their alexander did
not recognizing him as emperor and calling him but between
not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha he could
not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but i have
not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his former director could
not refrain from weeping at these words touched that this she could
not refuse to accompany you who will
not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel he could
not relate to them down below a man wearing something shouting did
not remain calm seeing him in such a plight she natasha could
not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the natasha did
not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the he did
not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess nicholas did
not reply but could
not reply but when they reported to him that murats kutuzov did
not reply he did
not reply he rode up to petya dismounted and with denisov did
not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had kutuzov did
not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should thought must
not ridden out on the evening of the twentyfourth to had napoleon
not rise rostov also tried to rise but fell back his but could
not said anything i only say that ill certainly go with why ive
not satisfied with her own words she felt that they did natasha was
not satisfied with this reply alpatych was
not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the he did
not say anything to her either pierre better
not say authority should
not say that there were no covering troops though that tushin did
not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind he could
not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who he did
not see the people as individuals but saw their movement pierre did
not seem to him senseless he understood and was not love did
not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to sonya had
not serve as material for science therefore could
not shift his eyes from one face to another as speranski did
not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth he did
not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger feeling though
not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in de tolly
not so much from the blow which had but slightly cut officer fell
not softened their disposition but had on the contrary pay had
not spare at such an important moment to return to him when he could
not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his andrew did
not speak like that their glances seemed to say certainly should
not speak rostov did
not speak to sonya again and avoided her with the natasha did
not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas i am
not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at pierre did
not stir she was in just the same position in which marya she did
not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain municipality did
not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to she is
not stupid she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she is
not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg boris had
not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her sonya did
not surprise pierre for she had become even handsomer woman did
not surrendered but had beaten the french russians had
not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov natasha did
not take her father away before the fifteenth he could princess did
not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber denisov did
not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in nicholas did
not take part and after that an armistice was pavlograds did
not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw had napoleon

odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and it seem
of 160000 russians and french all their passions human activities
of 1812 have long since left the stage their personal the actors
of a battle which we could not have refrained from the avoidance
of a bear and general commotion some eight or nine the growling
of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the or even
of a cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible awkward gait
of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to evidently glad
of a company berg who had obtained his captaincy during in command
of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the the horses
of a divine power some other force has appeared it if instead
of a dozen european nations burst into russia the the forces
of a dozen people it could not exist because it the imaginations
of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris and doings
of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damned the middle
of a general battle his hour has come mark my words afraid afraid
of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward the praise
of a hot bath come out
of a landowners house to the left of the road stood in front
of a large and active town which is always so that atmosphere
of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the population
of a maiden in transparent garments and beautiful representation
of a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to the sufferings
of a man who has repeated the same thing more than reproachful tone
of a matter that evidently distressed him speaking playfully
of a nose similar knobs over his black frowning brows and broad knob
of a people a general historian looks for the cause the subjugation
of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest the estate

of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp poured out
of a secretary rather than commander in the army my the part
of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged the case

of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning with an the air
of a too sensitive soul poisonous nourishment
of a universal favorite a very pleasant position province that
of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose and carved back
of a victory and general bennigsen hoping to receive with news
of a whole french squadron the day was bright and sunny the capture
of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and as part
of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an the depth
of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions people said
of a woman and the hoarse angry shouting of despairing sobs
of a woman close to him he stopped as if desperate weeping
of a woman the fatherland itself how important these society love
of a womans dress was heard in the next room prince the rustle
of abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other then words
of action the one kutuzov and the general mass of the possible line
of affairs he respectfully suggested on the plea that general course
of affairs in the russian army but no one general course
of age bolkonski he whispered pointing to the the feebleness
of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the same expression
of alertness and of readiness for anything was still that feeling
of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful the activity
of all but probably he knows it well enough and is only settled first
of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a was worst
of all i am growing old thats the thing there wont and worst
of all influences the intrigues flattery and those strongest
of all my subjects however i know their presence will and welfare
of all one must harness my wife is getting the meaning
of all people he most longed to love with this new pure natasha whom
of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an but instead
of all the animals is transferred from one leader to collective will
of all the forces and the emperor did not assume supreme commander

of all these people had changed since prince andrew inner relations
of all this we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall will come
of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count that kind
of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before but no notice
of amusement which someone for some reason had to continual round
of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass the spirit
of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that symmetrical pose
of an enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a the eye
of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused in spite
of an important personage whose complete confidence he the patronage

of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of an absence
of certain ends the greatness of russia or of the attainment
of chairs then one of those conversations began which the scraping
of chances give him power and all men as if by chance millions
of charity that i trouble myself about you and you also purely out
of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while little pyramid
of columns on a battlefield never coincides with threemile movement
of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as the word
of command the word
of communication the battle was fought and thousands were our lines
of complete freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the conception
of composure and imperturbable selfpossession if a man in society
of comprehension why you have read his letter and you friends lack
of compromising her and committing himself would now go for fear
of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of only out
of conflict but reported what they had heard from others actual place
of constraint or selfreproach on account of his outburst that no sign
of continuous events and examine it apart from others selected series
of continuous motion into discontinuous elements arbitrary division
of conviction with which he spoke kutuzov looked down at the strength
of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any familiar gallop
of cossacks a captain
of count bezukhovs death reached us before your letter and the news
of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the the participation
of course command it yourself said julie directing you will

of courting mary hendrikhovna she seeing herself general mood
of cowardice in the other both passed the examination detect signs
of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings the sounds
of cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and his moments
of culture are quite consistent in regard to their the historians
of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of the history
of culture to which all general histories tend more and the histories
of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the aim
of danger though still so weak that it was out of the now out
of death it stood behind the door but just when he was the fear
of death only the vicissitudes of life can show us its virtue love
of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing this enemy
of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and subdued chanting
of defeat and flight could not enter rostovs head the idea
of denisovs party had seized and carried off into morning cossacks
of dessaixs and friants divisions will move the howitzers
of different kinds fields and villages were forests
of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist longcherished aim
of disintegration he did not for instance say to himself in course
of distress in napoleons army rumors of guerrillas reports
of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said prose but
of dolokhov diverted petyas attention from the the arrival
of dolokhov who had no reason to preserve the honor the guiltlessness
of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke timid expression
of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the microscopic particles
of each individual which used to excite and legitimate peculiarity
of earth but have lived and shall live forever there this scrap
of earth were already being thrown over the whole but spadefuls
of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers had government thousands
of england and so on history shows us that these the baseness
of england but these justifications have a very the humiliation
of entrenchment a kind
of establishing intimacy with each of those present the possibilities
of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get the course
of events restoring the essential condition of corresponding series
of every thousand serfs as the smolensk gentry had equipped out
of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten natasha ate
of everything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed his and scorn
of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more the foreboding
of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room same state
of exercising their functions remains unnoticed she strive that
of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he a series
of expression on his face now his forehead would principal play
of expression on the face of the man who had been able to the play
of face or hands hands which were broad but delicate whiteness
of factory hands house serfs and peasants with enormous crowd
of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old mouth full
of fashion which she had worn at her first petersburg already out
of father amphilochus who led so holy a life that his long account
of favor explaining to him that there would probably be special marks
of fear prince andrew for the second time asked the faces that
of feet beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear regular tramp
of feet by all the borzois who did not get any closer to a couple
of feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna the shuffling
of felt boots on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn a pair
of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the a paroxysm
of fire they would have remained there for a long time the range
of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of preparing men

of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases the proportion
of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with scottish lodge
of french prisoners captured that day there were seven road groups
of french should show themselves fresh columns
of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the reappearance

of going there or not going there here there were no possibility
of going to the back entrance where his carriage and instead
of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare arm and loss
of goodnatured familiarity he laid his hand on the natural tone
of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper but enough
of great importance to me she said turning with a smile it is
of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post of the man
of great merit the latter was very attentive to anna the man
of great merit who was still a novice in court circles the man
of greatness
of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a gray mane
of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed unbrushed tufts
of happiness and of children but her strongest most mary dreamed
of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not this moment
of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the the shouts
of her alone that early and terrible death has had the to speak
of her and of lise his look tender yet proud she saw took leave
of her beauty and fearful because of it her face struck was aware
of her beauty youth and happiness as well as by involuntary envy
of her but what
of her condition expressed common understanding
of her conscience was astounded at having the case the director
of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion in one
of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before the meaning
of her father the terribly wild cries of her mother that the sight
of her for being his sister that there is no reason father and
of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that profoundest depths
of her leaning on his stick if you think something more in front
of her life the thought that theodosia alone had found was talking
of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her in front
of her misfortunes to intrude upon her take advantage
of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible in spite
of her own girlhood and her own first ball the irrecoverable days
of her own sins and she prayed to god to forgive and especially
of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she still thinking
of her own voice passing a mirror she glanced into it the sounds
of her own youth and of how there was something unnatural natasha and
of her request and must not be shown before the request the subject
of her saintsday fete turned away at once and the pleasure
of her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her was required
of her sons isnt it so papa said he the hearts
of her sturdy little legs and having examined the energetic steps
of her words a contradiction
of herself well and very nice too i need nobody caught sight
of herself while her face beamed with ecstatic and independently

of him among themselves kindly fun
of him and all his own simple relations with her her betrayal
of him and amused himself at his expense without letting made use
of him and loved him but he was kind and gentle only to were proud
of him and the same words rose to his lips but she took possession
of him and things were going from bad to worse for took advantage
of him but never attained in front
of him he heard what they said but did not understand they wanted
of him he thought and again he felt something terrible am afraid
of him if he had told me he was drunk and did mere recollection
of him inspired him with but little respect for the man had heard
of him making fun
of him prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her definite news
of himself
of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust in spite
of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single whole time
of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now he told
of his adventures detailed account
of his affairs he did not know at all how much he had what the state
of his affairs took advantage of the armistice to get the progress
of his aged body and of the necessity of physical physical weariness
of his battalion his steward his majordomo and various the colonel
of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom the hand
of his coldness the cause
of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance the ignorance
of his comrades talking of women began chaffing recovering one
of his death which she felt she could not contemplate the picture
of his detachment and could never be found commissariat affairs
of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former the cause
of his division to explain his violence at the the staff
of his dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich empty sleeve
of his employers happiness respectful understanding
of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and on one
of his former pupil
of his future activity in this direction rose in his mental image
of his good horse bedouin and sitting as though falling the sides
of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to starting out
of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to expressed forgiveness
of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till told her
of his life but he knew that this feeling customary conditions
of his life held his attention in particular his love great sorrows
of his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her telling him
of his lower jaw feverish twitching
of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the nicholas telling
of his mouth read to the austrian general the following the corners
of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods that morning
of his object and why he considered it better to risk his but also
of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth the son
of his orders during the battle not being as good as occasions and
of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and corn as
of his own he felt that it was not in his power to regain any fault
of his own knowledge and by talks with experts tried to the aid
of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead quoting one
of his patients in general and especially of the the characters
of his protege kutuzov but remained silent when the longer boasted
of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation inform him
of his regiments encampment through a gap in the further end
of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his the pocket
of his rupture with her if only it were possible for the cruelty
of his serfs he was joyfully planning this new life when the welfare
of his smile vanquished her she smiled just goodnatured tenderness
of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to dissipated life
of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in whole strength
of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had the depth
of his speech had obviously been made with the the commencement
of his statements the truth
of his stupid smile could not but give him a moments the seriousness
of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing kindly the middle
of his thighbone had been extracted the torn splintered portions
of his time away from home at dinners parties and greater part
of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being got out
of his uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his black collar
of his uprightness and meekness reward him according to be mindful
of his various meetings with him and especially their friendship
of his way prince andrew did neither a look of animosity step out
of his weaknesses was aware
of his wifes property and having received a small selling any
of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything into one
of his will otherwise than as a limitation nevervarying direction
of history focused upon him a character exposed to blinding light
of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not the subject
of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to the sea
of homes where there are very young and very atmosphere characteristic
of honor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing the guard
of honor and had twice regained his commission for affairs
of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince the guest
of honor was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down a guard
of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and the maid
of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red rhythmic beat
of hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and the sound
of how he would either make his father consent to this and spoke
of how she ought to behave to him first she continually thought
of how she would go in nor of what she would say what coiffure nor
of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin moscow and
of how things would be after his death and imagination thoughts
of how to get away quickly and save himself himself and
of human life are fixed and may not be oerpassed the limits
of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and the sum
of humanity and were brothers both children

of illuminism others supporting him at that accusing pierre
of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading if instead
of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some monks hands smelled
of inevitability
of inevitability and a maximum of freedom a minimum

of it he now approached the sick man with the noiseless even approved
of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and was informed
of it its the truth and he himself smiled his gentle pierre what
of it read only to forget if but for a moment understanding half
of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity and falsehood
of it said uncle im fond
of it the chief thing in his eyes was not the particular part
of it they could not understand that i have not the necessary get out
of it to speak
of it true but when napoleon asked him whether the orderlies much
of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his the worst

of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it the idea
of life devoting himself with special activity to building former way
of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium the bloom

of smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising the curtain
of smoke that overlay the whole space in front mysterious domain
of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a a lump

of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each these hundreds
of soldiers some of whom were unwounded the soldiers were a crowd
of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the is that
of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this the commanders
of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them empty space
of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of a system
of some wine asked for that there were no more charges no more

of strenuous and free activity quite opposed to the spiritual a world
of submitting for a time to this new order of things the necessity
of such men when they encounter anyone who shows and necessity
of sympathy and less the result of free will the less deserving
of tactics which is accepted as infallible that wellknown rule
of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had the battle
of tea ivanushka sipping out of her saucer looked another cup
of telyanins pale terrified face began to quiver his every muscle

of that approaching catastrophe one of his brother masons for signs
of that apron which symbolized strength and purity the whiteness
of that army were sharply distinguished kutuzovs three parts

of that wish but find a series of orders or an expression
of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed the moan

of the 13th light regiment was undoubtedly a very ramballe captain
of the action balls and shells began flying all the commencement
of the action i think i sent you he added turning very beginning
of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that have become
of the activity of many men or of an whatever presentation

of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even the beast

of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal the plight
of the whole campaign enclosed for them a plan he had brief account
of the will of someone endowed with power but that the expression
of the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for looked out
of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms separating and one
of the words and made no kind of deduction from or the meaning
of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them the success
of their investigation the range
of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe thinking only
of their victories over the russians and would pretend to tell me
of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will every act
of them and so he had left them and wished to pay them than any
of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed was said

of them we find and each separate cause or whole series of the more
of them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his and those
of these last moments of meeting between the pathetic importance
of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar the hindmost
of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles during one
of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if during one
of these preparations for war lay in the fact that whole interest
of these projects but even that he cannot do events and choose one
of these proved possible petya could not return unless but neither
of these purposes the more obvious it becomes that the the discovery
of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people the rulers
of thirtyfive and at the same time for a fascinating marquise
of this and b governor general of that and that appointed minister
of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration in consequence
of this bombardment the meaning
of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were in spite
of this contradiction lies in the fact that the the source
of this edifice of needles he also saw by glimpses a the construction
of this morning which i feel is dawning for me the three white light
of this movement by what laws was it governed asks the the cause
of this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and dron was
of this party said and thought that what was wrong the men
of this position that here was the toulon that would lift it out
of this position they say a fortified outpost was set in front
of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features in spite
of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and a taste
of this strange dear clever man whom even my father the equal
of this strange fact given by russian military the explanation
of those around him is not at once represented as a great the mouths
of those around remembered all he had already gone serious faces
of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of the number
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals the question
of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted largest party
of those that were being trampled on and of those who the screams
of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his were none
of those waves will be the only perceptible motion the movement
of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for the voices
of those who did the actual fighting less any
of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to courtiers one
of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after the motives
of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair to one

of voices was heard the sound
of war at which prince andrew had not been able to the council
of war at which suvorov crowed like a cock in reply austrian council
of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the council
of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and the minister

of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german him something

of what had once been an army napoleon himself and the members
of what is just and unjust it is understandable that a or think
of what ought and what ought not to be done the first felt certain
of what she was telling he listened to her and felt only death nor
of what steps to take and the enormous number of and ignorance
of what the generals were disputing about rather than
of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by hear nothing
of what was long past princess mary spoke of her spoke most
of what went on before her she only felt understood anything
of what went on having made up his mind once for all that the rest
of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the the sound
of wheels the tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger the rattle
of which could be seen in the failing twilight and as if the flames
of which he was evidently in need a further proof to some money
of which i understand nothing and the day countermarches things
of which ilya rostov blushed with selfconscious at sight
of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the carrying out
of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were the candlestick

one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to taken by
one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind the hill
one shouted a man as a whistling shell approached a live
one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard started to
one side and puff with a pause puff puff floating to
one side and very becoming to his handsome face having set on
one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes bending to
one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant now on
one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans on the
one side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly water to
one slippered and one booted foot he advanced while timidly in
one so that he an exemplary officer of twentytwo years had made
one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers kutuzov no
one talk or think of such trifles thought pierre how can
one talk to the masters like that what were you thinking how can
one that could save the army and how he alone would be the only
one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard one by
one then another he said he would not have been addressing first

one thing and then another natasha first

one thing to carry away and eat those green passionately desired
one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natasha though at
one to another and a page the same one rostov had something from
one to another now he would take up the position of a andrew from
one to do he asked evidently expecting an answer dont whats
one to do my dear hussar whats
one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the distance lured
one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a more than
one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch very best
one two said pierre and a silence followed well now
one uhlan stopped another who was on foot flung disordered lines
one was nearer to him or farther from him than another there whom not
one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and tower clock
one where the battle was fought far from being strong borodino the
one which enjoined every mason to set an example of fulfill the
one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at command the
one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he terrible in
one will ask me that i shall not be among the first to possible no
one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful and no
one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles he lets
one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the the prince
one with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged wounded men
one with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to the ditch
one with his family and entering into all the details making himself
one with his horse rode past the emperor with a feeling himself
one word after another came through the open door voice hurrying
ones breath away the rate we flew we came across a train of it took
ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the to have
ones most distant past in which dreams and realities impressions of

only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into there was
only one hut available for the regimental commander there was
only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything there was
only one who loves is capable evidently suffering himself of which

only the first words amiably and then again arakcheev uttering
only the one most essential thing as much advantage bennigsen but
only the reports most flattering to our army were followed and
only the rostovs remained but he did not go to see intimate friends
only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as no its
only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it wounded as

only was it impossible to make out what was happening from but not
only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her that the
only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts but on them not
only what took place within his own mind interested all evidently
only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving roused himself
only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to laughter and
only which was the better match and how the matter would possible but
only with internal and external applications of tikhon treated
only without interest but even as if ashamed of what listened not

only wonders at the longsuffering or blindness of the before one

seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to pocket on
seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and place pierre
seeing balashev and the emperor returning to the garden where
seeing boris the one who was writing and whom boris position on
seeing her kuragin was much more sensible and simple with pleasure of
seeing her master stretched her hind legs lay down like a up on
seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and to avoid
seeing his face moved away andrew from
seeing in history innumerable instances of the military science
seeing in the forward thrust of her husbands head she stopped
seeing rostov before him with whom he would inevitably angrily on
seeing that his father insisted began at first prince andrew
seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre a toy
seeing the prince but made up his mind to address him confused at
seeing things each from his own point of view this feeling and
seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute power of
seeing you and if you wont do this i will i will write to or cease
seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the therefore you
seeking a reply pierre paused
seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life you are
seeking the correlation of cause and effect in peoples directed to
seem less guilty that is less free and more subject defenseless man
seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in it would
seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but did not
seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing others must
seem to be required to retain the brilliant position genius would
seem to be used to riding count remarked the adjutant you dont
seem to him that everyone is afraid of him and that must it must
seem to see before me as i write well and
seemed about to cry but this did not last long puckered he
seemed altogether so thin small and pathetic his motionless he
seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts luminous it
seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss that it
seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and reply it
seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as march it
seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage and they all
seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least he himself
seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him whose head
seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow all this
seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk the italian
seemed have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner would it
seemed impossible but perhaps they may do it for more kill him
seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine german and
seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied by the and there
seemed not to matter whether all or only half the arrested it
seemed not to notice he enlivened the whole party the presence he
seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances as they
seemed pleased to have someone to wait on that same surprise and
seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that mother natasha
seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there effort it
seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he would have
seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently sly eyes too
seemed strange to him that his longfelt wish which had before it
seemed tired and in a hurry the doctor
seemed to be saying so much the worse for you sentiments he
seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife tedious none
seemed to deride his own helplessness at sight of this features that
seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in entangled it
seemed to her that not only did everybody know that trepidation it
seemed to her that this difference arose from the sometimes it
seemed to him an hour his arms felt numb his legs eyes bandaged
seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him ended it
seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind remarks which
seemed to him equally meaningless they all
seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of terrible order
seemed to him essential to see natasha in the evening he affair it
seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he his plate
seemed to him that he was being fired at what what once it
seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a elated it
seemed to him the horses were not moving at all at last door it
seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man articles which
seemed to him was solely due to napoleon which it
seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult the generals
seemed to natasha go go said the mother sadly and coldly it
seemed to pierre that the french officers head had been torn and it
seemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see her at her
seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he him she
seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed suddenly he
seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step and in left he
seemed to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the they now
seemed to say yes theres nothing left for you and me her sigh
seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than the princess
seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive epaulettes which
seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that this problem
seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully did a future
seemed topsyturvy all the doors were open all the rostovs house
seemed unnatural to prince andrew gesture too
seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would and trial
seemed very gay they all
seems he is ill people are always disturbing him yes it
seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the theory
seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie sorrow it
seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of in society
seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this well it
seems to be all right pierre concluded and followed them it
seems to be getting quieter remarked ferapontov well it
seems to me so it
seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you cant years it
seems to me that life is not over for him but realized it
seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel so it
seen
seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was she had
seen as much before now mate i have
seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting balashev had
seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should had i
seen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed should have
seen him three times natasha i dont believe you youre have only
seen in pregnant women and suddenly began to cry is only
seen it in paris quite clear and very pleasing who had
seen lying down she had
seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in had only
seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the already be
seen smile was
seen the body of petya rostov that same day he had learned he had
seen the emperor but there was no one beyond the ditch now he had
seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely was clearly
seen the princess she asked indicating with a have you
seen the princess she replied i heard that they were i have
seen you have seen kutuzov shouted frowning and you have
sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the foreigner who
sees that things are going so badly that they listeners everybody
seize the apparently elusive the life of a people describe and
seized him at the thought of that dreadful incomprehensible terror
seized princess marys hand frightened expression
seized the man a french officer by the shoulder with one hands and
seizes him in his helplessness unavoidable destruction
seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer at last
seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away son and
seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round she had
seldom listened now he was seldom carried away in talked and
self and to attain this end we have the light called perfect ones
selfabasement
selfassured as being a citizen of the bestorganized englishman is
selfconfidence remains dumb on a first introduction and lacking in
selfconfidence secure him military fame innumerable audacity and
selfconfident haughty and
selfesteem would be wounded and his point not to princess marys
selfindulgence
selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone conceited and
selfperfecting besides this he advised me for selfknowledge and
selfreproach and emotion as if justifying themselves feeling of
selfreproach for having let him go anxiety and
selfsacrifice and a present conciousness of the future history of
selfsacrifice now feeling herself bound to princess of christian
selfsacrifice with the possibility of a reward is more mother or
selfsatisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along agility and
selfsatisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly with the
selfsatisfied lighthearted and
selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation a joyous

she added giving pierre to understand that they were almost time
she added in a whisper your return
she added looking smilingly at the little girl who were parted
she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to on me
she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs quickly and
she again met anatole in the little sitting room helene and that
she again smilingly said to him well then remember wife when
she almost screamed so as to drown his voice tell you
she also danced with him anatole said nothing when ecossaise which
she always felt that her case did not sound quite which language
she and i may be man and wife he told himself everything that
she answered questions at random began sentences she unnatural state
she answered you noticed nothing her look asked oh yes
she asked
she asked and bolkonski
she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to where is
she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit and when
she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he helene nor
she became still more animated and chattered away acquaintances and
she began at last sedately he remained silent your offer
she began rapidly prince bolkonski was your peter kirilovich
she began to sob more bitterly than before natasha and again
she began to speak passed through such transitions as she voice when
she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince my advice
she blushed continually and was irritable it seemed the evenings
she brought them until the count himself in his strange order
she called to him carry me downstairs petya petya
she caught the unfinished word in its flight and single gesture
she come prowling here what does she want i cant bear why does
she concealed from him her intention of keeping him officer though
she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and with me
she conducted him to her aunt as
she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of the idea
she could demand this and she received what she nizhegorod forests
she could give no directions about state institutions for replied that
she could hear all that passed in the study through which
she could mademoiselle bourienne too seemed passionately as best
she could not be at ease felt that
she could not believe that there was nothing to and tenderness
she could not doubt and at any rate loved the understand still
she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying sonya for it
she could not refrain from turning round she looked herself and
she could not see anything and again settled down in her evident that
she could not share it but she could not understand regretted that
she could not think of it without tears and did not touching that
she could not understand why he was so particularly and alien
she could say what she did not think especially fascinating woman
she could understand nothing think of nothing and feel and sunny
she covered her eyes her when
she cried oh natasha
she dances what gwace he said again after a pause and how
she described seen what
she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in knowing how
she did not but with her pregnancies her thought that
she did not even for a moment consider what she should guided her
she did not even get up to greet him what malevolent expression
she did not go away it was all the same to him he declared that if
she did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped sit still
she did not know what to say and turned away as if improper intention
she did not understand and lay down again he strange expression
she did not understand why he stepped out from the harvest in
she did not venture to ask any questions and shut the turned away
she directly said
she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her really because
she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being neither could
she doubts the means we have of gaining them that is the them and
she embraced her friend but noticing sonyas look of of awakening
she entered with her heavy step treading on her bourienne when
she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too the contrary
she evidently considered it proper to show an interest little cat
she exclaimed as she ran past and denisov felt that he hes come
she exclaimed but hearing her masters voice she what marvels
she expressed by voice smile and glance she wrote to him of what
she feel thought he if she saw me here now on this what would
she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the day before
she felt a need to speak spitefully the pretext would be and when
she felt a submissive tender love for this man something different
she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed her if
she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenly slackened
she felt herself all the time in an awkward position whole matter
she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of so that
she felt that his incomprehensible words had an himself but
she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there said nothing
she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within face and
she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused unnatural that
she forced boris to say all that is said on selfsatisfaction but
she forgot all fear of her father went up to him took within her
she found them on my table and said shed show them to others and
she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of face vanished
she gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the the opera
she gave her companion an angry glance human race
she gave it up just because it was so powerfully powerful part
she glided away and how she carries herself for so beauty as
she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach the ground
she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at still smiling
she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had grownup lady
she had a gift and all this was unconsciously accepted from for which
she had a right to ask him for anything except only for now feel
she had a stomach a brain muscles nerves and a merely because
she had acquired though she did not understand its characteristic tact
she had aged during the five years he had known her and broken how
she had been married during the previous winter and being also there
she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a how long
she had been thinking about something else but she had noticed that
she had been told that anatole was married with some night after
she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee in petersburg
she had heard before mot which
she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew from tales
she had just vacated you have made the place warm i the chair
she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now all day
she had more of them that she might pray for them but been wishing
she had never experienced before all that was distressing pride as
she had not experienced for a long time that of a sensation
she had not intended her flight to bring her so far evident that
she had not known for a long time such as
she had not meant it seriously it makes it as if you were as if
she had played a little air with variations on the first after
she had pulled him down toward her and covered his natasha after
she had reached home was natasha able clearly to think only after
she had said flushed and excited prince andrew describe it
she had then said that he turned to look at her and remembered what
she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt know why
she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors certain though
she has no pride but ill let her see bourienne no
she has talked of him like that first time
she he whispered to natasha handsome isnt
she heard only metiviers voice then her fathers then at first
she help loving nicholas and knowing that his neither could
she hows my cossack marya dmitrievna always called well said
she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone anna mikhaylovna
she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was shyness which
she is a depraved woman now i have spoken that terrible truth that
she is a pearl among women princess he added turning door oh
she is a sterile flower you know like some strawberry come off
she is and turning to his groom he said he would give a of borzoi

she is natasha remarked to her father who had how beautiful
she is said the old count when he saw natasha enter ah here
she is she will be a weal beauty said denisov how sweet
she is the queen of petersburg countess bezukhova said ah here
she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas had finished
she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her the neck
she kissed his rough curly black head at this not understand
she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and first and
she knew of his relation to natasha to get better implying that
she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous say all
she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this and more
she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel the same
she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would told her
she left her room a listless old woman taking no month later
she left the hall revoir and
she like other women vera meant herself attachments could
she liked to be with him better than with the others brother petya
she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome wife as
she listened to what was going on behind the door and on waking
she locked her in and having given orders to the tearless eyes
she look about with pleasure smiling joyfully this strange
she looked at the faces of the audience seeking in them at them
she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by sometimes as
she looked straight into his handsome face as it came courage but
she loved both and was afraid of grieving either and that
she loved him but she also loved anatole of that there how deeply
she loved him he thought god could not have put seducer when
she loved or been cruelly deceived by him though nothing of the man
she loved prince andrew she remembered distinctly prince andrew
she loves me girl and
she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears his daughter
she might at least have some for my sake she must be for herself
she must not say this and that it would be useless to do she knew
she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuis mon enfant
she need not make a fool of herself shes plain daughterinlaw but
she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety just what
she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle the conversation
she one hears such improbable wonders about you yourself said
she only saw something large brilliant and handsome not see
she ought to write tormented her now that he was already and whether
she passed between the men who made way for her sparkling diamonds
she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples but as
she paused all were silent expectant of what was to evident duty
she paused and stood listening to the conversation conservatory there
she pleaded forever forever
she preferred what did it matter to anybody and the life
she pretty ah friend my pink one is delicious her well is
she pretty he asked with a wink eh is
she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet andrusha said
she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped something as
she really reminds me of somebody but herr dimmler isnt looks like
she recalled all her life with him and in every word and losing him
she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its went before
she recalled his looks his sympathy and his sometimes when
she refused him quite definitely adding after a and fancy
she repeated as if unable to understand to petersburg
she repeated the same thing twice several times
she repeating the mistake of so many parents who confidence said
she replied blushing with pleasure too hot
she replied in a frightened voice no father
she rode up to them ilagin lifted his beaver friendly greetings
she rose
she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced away again
she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up it and
she said
she said aloud i shall look forward very much to goodby count
she said answering something quite different i too yes yes
she said excuse me
she said giving natasha a significant look the old high time
she said going to the very middle of the room now sonya
she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned her children
she said not letting go of his arm and they went come come
she said that it was all over and that hes now an no but
she said to her son but who could help loving julie latterly
she said to her son once more stimulating him by a my dear
she said to herself and sinking into a chair she let her hinder you
she said to pierre even our dear cousin boris who know count
she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no though what
she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated and now
she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the expression and
she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he and wept
she saw prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the wick and
she say it yes i shall look forward very much to your how did
she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of sterile flower
she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk longdrawn sigh
she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish victorious beauty
she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for frightened lest
she shuddered seeing what she had probably never physiognomy changed
she shut her eyesno theres nothing at all boris no
she sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else correct as
she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt arinka look
she smiled again and dutched prince vasilis arm more moment then
she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of rays and
she smiled at pierre through her tears good nothing nothing
she so wanted a word from him that would explain to she paused
she soon be confined and shaking his head and will
she spoke of her exalted patroness supported helenes with which
she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her usual but
she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her reproach as
she suddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark nearing home
she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being mary said
she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the my place
she thought only of one thing her sorrow which after about them
she thought perhaps he would then have said to me what he the room
she told her intimate friends and these were all goodnatured naivete
she told him that the wax with the babys hair had not approval when
she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also extraordinary when
she took it quickly and bent her head over it princess face
she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of and if
she tried to follow with understanding when she service which
she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible wished and
she turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed was kuragin
she turned away for an instant why too much she asked and i
she turned to his father the conversation was general interest him
she turning to the young man who having come quite opinion said
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count about whom
she want he murmured she is bringing me my daughter what does
she wanted nothing more take her
she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all rostova that
she was angling for you how could she say such a thing mamma said
she was angry with the travelers and would immediately have thought
she was being asked to entertain this young man and understood that
she was better now natasha had not left her room that but that
she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself very wealthy
she was calling on the rostovs for that purpose the together and
she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the newcomer as
she was dancing with a grownup partner she bent her forgetting that
she was even more attractive than in former days developed body
she was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice offended her
she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with handsome and
she was informed that rostov had called with a firm nephews lessons
she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been young wife
she was joyfully conscious of a return of that princess mary
she was not bonapartes servant was really consciousness that
she was not going to have any children by me and that
she was not guilty whether she had not already itself whether
she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen ashamed as
she was pretty but this no longer gave her certain that
she was right said countess mary with a happy smile laughing and
she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that for natasha
she was tired and panting and evidently thought of chose her
she was to do with these people on leaving them inquiring what
she was unable to stop him something inappropriate
she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt remain wherever
she went downstairs his back
she went in the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat be and
she went on gaining a little strength he is nice boris also
she went on indicating pierre put him universal freemason
she went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel remained silent
she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion very last
she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath one day
she went through the accounts with alpatych conferred with to them
she went to the table set down the tray and with her very lightly
she went to the window and opened it through the open irritably and
she whispered
she whispered raising her head and glancing at him forgive me
she who had herself suffered so much could render and friendship as
she will she saw something last year i know
she will whispered natasha but did not finish of course
she wished to give she was glad such cares presented the grain
she with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats her and
she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part more that
she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time now in
she would die of fright if they did not leave that very said that
she would prepare the countess and after tea with gods till teatime
she would say he is too noble and puresouled for yes count
she would say she said this cant go on it wont you think what
she would still be told the same all the way she had sat she might

smile at his coat and boots my things are worn and goodnatured
smile at what was before him and listened to what was seemingly ironic
smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he tried to
smile did not enhance veras beauty as smiles generally but the
smile i am boris son of princess anna slightly sarcastic
smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in a puzzled
smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him boris sometimes that
smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came with the
smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m a beatific
smile of selfsatisfaction at being able clearly to a decorous
smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes without a
smile returning his

smile rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the beneath his
smile she had met him in secluded passages and artless
smile that never left his face jauntily shifting the with a
smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that the general
smile which had left his face while he was speaking the stupid

smolensk as the place where they hope to recover during they regard
smolensk at the malakhov gate he had hardly dozed off in army in
smolensk for those defended by two such brave armies inhabitants of

smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put on reaching
smolensk onwards he wished to stop knew the danger of his that from
smolensk or vilna or remain in moscow in short no special return to
smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell reached the
smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe is retreat from

snow and toward evening it began to clear through the lightly falling
snow been shoveled back has the
snow he held the pistol in his right hand at arms length the deep
snow into a birch forest to the right of the village through the
snow melts theyll sink in the polish swamps only they when the
snow so soft and light fell the
snow to somewhere else and how soandso routed and kneedeep in
snow was melting and black shadows of soldiers crackled the
snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince the soft
snowcovered road did not once wake up on the way to across the
snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out fence the
snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry holding the
snuffbox nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up dropped the
so after his long privations at posting and intoxicatingly
so again and again and that will be the end of it my theyll say
so agitated society abolishing court ranks and prepared that
so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is you think
so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and to rome
so and dont talk to me dont dont isnt that
so and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore was called
so and what did he say inquired bolkonski is that
so andso and then i take a cab and go myself two interview with
so artificially because he was talking french expressing himself
so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and to stir
so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the actually had
so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a it is
so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards he done
so before one can know it is necessary to believe and to self and
so berg drew pierre to it discussion and
so blocked by vehicles and troops so many things had been had been
so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in your doing
so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a that by
so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the found itself
so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of hitherto had
so correspond in the latter but did
so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed root would
so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that beloved france
so deep in thought that he did not hear the question pierre was
so disconcerted by this longforeseen inquiry that without count was
so do you see and he pushed anatoles head forward to and then
so drove away too leaving those who could not to surrender could do
so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect voice obviously
so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their everyone waited
so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the i am
so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and hearts and
so far away that as appeared later he could not know napoleon was
so firm a smile that expressed nothing nor had he heard such eyes or
so fond of he remembered his mothers love for him everyone is
so forth is equally right with the child who stands under decays and
so full of germans that a russian cannot exist and headquarters are
so futile and insignificant in comparison with the everything seemed
so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the well prince
so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i i am
so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of i was
so glad youve come said natasha without answering him we i am
so god will punish you she said admonishingly turning to speak
so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into count be
so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and please be
so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had irony and
so happy i am
so he begged take me to her take me to her its the you whole
so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled i say
so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry fortune and
so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he to do
so he did not like zdrzhinskis tale nor did he like it and
so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked well and
so he went from one group to another some of the most guests and
so her about
so i expect
so i have killed two birds with one stone to appease unpunished and
so i have saved your life and i save your honor having he did
so i like being alone father likes her very much she even more
so i lived for others and not almost but quite their approval
so i must explain it and he must hear me out doesnt understand
so i went for them with my ax this way what are little swords
so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own agreeable and
so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when rostov felt
so ill we women prince and she smiled tenderly always know he is
so illegal an intention but simply that the have opposed
so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the men seemed
so important that he took no notice of what went on question one
so it is essential to explain what is meant by power destroyed and
so it is impossible to say precisely when or by whom abandon moscow
so it is possible to find some connection contemporaneously and
so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to times and
so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign darent say
so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so this heart
so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating she is
so lads isnt it
so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the it was
so long and replacing their purses and pocketbooks after sitting
so long he felt in his own person the sufferings and death had served
so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do ah i
so loud and merrily that denisov in his bedroom rostov laughed
so love their theory that they lose sight of the theoreticians who
so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more others and
so making a great effort she did however go to call on about doing
so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to has suffered
so many people appeared contemptible and to bolkonski
so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in and papers
so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army there are
so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sparkled with
so monsieur pierre he concluded you think
so much and was so goodnatured that everybody trusted mitenka
so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on his role
so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of there was
so much heart he is so pure and poetic that my relations with and has
so much in fun as in earnest and her mother was now otradnoe not
so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know been through
so much so that the only thing left to do seemed french involuntarily
so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual you say
so much the better so much the better monsieur momentary pause
so much the better you are certainly brave foes bah really
so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchins hearing not
so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg company and
so naive a question will he agree to ask
so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that roads was
so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it it seemed
so necessary for a young man as the society of clever nothing is
so noticeable as in marya dmitrievnas broad stern the holiday
so often heard from his fellow hussars he had
so on and these pictures of the future had given him her and
so on but these orders and reports were only on paper naples and
so on evstafeys representation pierre had to put off his that day
so on health and
so on like all those polish names prishprish and
so on on and
so on that pierre became quite bewildered and only permits and
so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon were told
so on what for people in their full vigor is an aim cleared and
so patiently thought she looking at sonya who also came long and
so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and half and
so princess mary looked inquiringly at her father he was had done
so quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures would be
so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his he spoke
so readily as they did hers what can i do where can ones orders
so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and you think
so rendering their own plight still worse treated prisoners and
so replied the man we heard
so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced steps and
so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that asked natasha
so she wont come down it is natural in her state bright smile
so slight a wound but now he took advantage of it to regiment for
so smooth and regular is now
so soon you ready
so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for now felt
so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such i am
so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children said ah im
so splendid she said how she understands children it mary is
so strange that one could not take it in but then the said was
so strangely in that brilliant light she knew what it was and sang
so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait it completely
so that by the the time it reached vilna it numbered the season
so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was full gallop
so that his face was not visible the cavalry singers were lay prone
so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face no mustache
so that his quill spluttered and squeaked if you have on writing
so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew all news
so that she understood that he had long been waiting pressed hers
so that she was not invited to dinners and evening out himself
so that the left flank was at shevardino the right flank acute angle
so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and tender murmur
so that this airy structure should not collapse but was difficult
so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be gods but live
so that what once seemed good ten years later mankind changes
so that you may not suffer want and if you have been our grain
so the first task pierre had to face was one for and workshops
so the intentions of the french highness could
so the locality and the position of our troops were known to would do
so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him it and
so then is not
so they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin frankly said
so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room she was
so to me what have i done to you you are going to the have changed
so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be activity was
so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have she should
so was the countess but natasha who had bustled about dressing and
so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly natasha knew
so well and was so cunning and wise that when he killed them
so well established that no one took his freaks petersburg was
so you are once more an eligible bachelor said yes and
so you no longer wish to marry boris nice and
so you too are in the great world said he to there now
so young and i thought that as my sons friend you daughter is
so yourself and the main thing is he continued that i not think
so youve smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just well fwiend
soandso and soandso did and said this and that and that prince
soandso but she did not even see the emperor and only attention of
soap and all as the soldiers say there was only articles awl

tender and confiding affection for his sister he betrothed and
tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling his steady
tender smile on his face with a
tender that he had not seen in her before and bewitchingly
tenderly and old mary ivanovna who had grown fond passionately and
tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden himself as
tenderly paternal way unexpected and
tenderness for her stronger and more vivid than ever love and
tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward simplest paternal
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly of the
tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest care and
tenfold and their life which seemed to have immediately increased

terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear again that
terrible news from her till after her confinement which hide the
terrible pain what is that pain like why does he struggling with

terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater obscure and
terrible thoughts would give him no peace he knew therefore most
terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power oh its
terrible was becoming unbearable those uncomprehended and
terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but and that
terribly close to him she already had power over him and she was
terrified mobs the generals reformed them but disorganized and

than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than always stronger
than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of for more
than all else is to love this life in ones sufferings more blessed
than any words could have done did he betray to clearly clearer
than anyone and so you dont deserve to have them them less
than as he had been here she now saw him again as he him otherwise
than at any other time and understood all that is more insight
than before the light was so strong and the snow even brighter
than before the saturated road no longer absorbed raining harder
than ever because anatoles presence had vividly recalled now more
than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not eyes more
than ever under the observation of all these eyes of the less free
than ever was boris resolved to serve in future not drubetskoy more
than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and losing more
than he had done before now that he was sure of being more clearly

than nicholas had ever seen her before and prettier
than on all the others who took part in it never to the lay more

than that afternoon she felt that as she brought with her more boldly
than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples rome us better
than the frightened and bewildered mitenka the conversation even less
than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question other answer
than the others forced his way in to see him and respected less
than the trend of the conversation and thats a thoughts rather
than this one not worse
than verses and bagration again preceding all the more important

that a command is executed only when it is related to a occur find
that a criminal was reared among male factors original action
that a report was received from dorokhovs guerrilla soon after
that a true freemason should be a zealous worker benefactors words
that act had not been committed much that resulted from it that if
that activity displeases somebody this is only because it harmful if
that address anna pavlovnas guests talked for a long animated by
that after every ball that hit the redoubt and after pierre noticed
that agitated enraptured and tormented me said he false images
that air of unconcern indifference and benevolence interest him
that all the icons had been taken out of the churches contrary said
that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know not only
that all their words and feelings seemed an insult so commonplace
that all these men now that they had stopped amid it seemed
that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will he knew
that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to rule says
that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne mistake and
that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but my hand and
that and pierre was released natasha on one side was playing like
that and secondly if the russian nobility had that emperor about
that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said it means
that another line of thought had sprung up and while was conscious
that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing not surmise
that anything was hidden from her but because she had countess not
that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased boris understood
that as a great favor he had petitioned the being circulated
that as he does not understand its use he does not believe in to say
that as the only remaining choice was between losing the moscow and
that asked anna pavlovna securing silence for the what whats
that asked boris who was
that asked the countess as if she did not know what the what is
that assembly was to inculpate him and so as they had object of
that at a single word from that man all this vast mass he felt
that auntie might at any moment get angry that at already afraid
that before discussing these questions pierre i think
that began almost the same air and then with a another instrument
that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting how is
that being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to and suddenly
that belonged to the landlord in bogucharovo
that besides these changes it would be necessary to go but remarked
that blockhead he said in reply to the question from the oh tell
that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief replied emaciated face
that boris wished to change the subject and being of the pierre saw
that boy well and
that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe always declared
that burntcork mustache that he had fully learned to thanks to
that business but above all that thought was kept out of lives on
that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so one considers
that caleche she knew it was right in front eyes sought
that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and the swelling
that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the someone mentioned
that case i drink to our friendship he cried gaily well in
that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the but in
that case the question arises whether all the activity of the but in
that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the gray bitch
that child
that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was oh how
that circassian was sonya and that sonya was certainly his there and
that circle the moscow enthusiasm news of which had settled in
that city him in
that consciousness is not subject to reason only proves
that constituted the whole reward for her selfsacrifice very thing
that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but to share
that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these the reasons
that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all give them
that count mamonov was furnishing a regiment bezukhov at having heard
that creaks or makes more noise than it should and there one
that creature said you are angry you are jealous little nose
that crossing of the berezina about which so much has progression and
that crowd natasha heard and felt that several people were rows of
that crowd terrible screams arose petya galloped up and the midst of

that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in seen had
that day but had heard about them from an infantry hussars all
that day on dessalles mentioning that the french were at dinner
that day or the next and giving him full liberty to an engagement
that day she returned to the old way of life which she mornings and
that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to she seemed
that day with the other arrested suspects as the was placed
that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness what way
that deed responsibility of
that denisov was a hero the esaul a hero and tikhon rubbishy german
that denisov was asleep he rose and went out of then noticing
that design but undertook an expedition into russia with to execute
that despite these losses his income would not be estimate showing
that devil hits out hes made my face all bloody said there how
that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english while explaining
that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him the news
that dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly he offhand way
that done which settled the matter and who was to blame when was
that door was heard a noise of things being moved about door through
that dropped of themselves from that withered tree fallen leaves
that escort but when they reached the supply stores they belonging to
that eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the soul to
that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow last reach
that even in the next world only the gentry are to have it seems
that evening
that evening and next day reports came in one after but all
that evening even those playing cards behind the partition with her
that evening had met
that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly country and
that evening to the officer of the horse guards the staff
that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at long time
that every event that occurs inevitably coincides civilization so
that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing to her
that everyone could hear deliberately so
that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor the war
that everyone regarded the italian in the same light and he to him
that everyone will say that you drunk and not knowing all moscow
that exclaimed petya why shouldnt i go i like
that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a ancient societies
that expression of attention to something within her that while with
that falls on the things about him we see that each of the light
that fatal force which had crushed him during the felt that
that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness enemy and
that fellow get here asked pierre how did
that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet full strength
that filled his soul with joy and word
that fine fellow bonaparte lose hed knock all this should let
that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full it was
that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous men so
that follows therefrom and all
that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and the birches
that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men i imagine
that frenchwoman blame is
that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war telling us
that from their point of view as plasterers everything be delighted
that from whom came a sleepy voice what whats
that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted continued with
that general ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning the fact
that gosling i have made an eagle subsequently termed
that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay under others of
that had become too tight for him he was agitated noblemans uniform
that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened and hopes
that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged wooden fence
that had been revealed to him was kneeling before him he divine love
that had been running down pierres back now seized his the chill
that had been so humiliating in her mornings visit remembered all
that had formerly burned there and everglowing animation
that had gone on in front a battery
that had haunted him but because his conception of the questions
that had held under those on foot collapsed in a great mass the ice
that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and the question
that had prevented her taking part in life oppressive constraint
that had previously been invisible could now be seen to the horses
that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an the wagons
that had restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased of life
that had scanned her person while natasha was like a girl of looks
that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself the line
that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally and that all
that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive whats that
that hath shall be given and from him that hath not to him
that he alone could maintain command of the army in was convinced
that he alone had experienced and known all the sincere conviction
that he and his companion were trying to overtake dolokhov said
that he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly emperors name
that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue who is
that he attached too much importance to these matters but alone and
that he can act as he pleases every man savage or the experiment
that he controlled the external actions of all administrators
that he could be silent in this way for a very long was evident
that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind sat so strong
that he could not answer it he replied
that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy dimly felt
that he could not tell him his name and blushing pierre replied
that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted pressed so
that he decided to go the thought immediately accustomed to
that he did so delighted them the discovery
that he had abandoned everything and not left the city moscow and
that he had been awaiting the boyars so long appearing ridiculous
that he had been ordered to hand it personally to balashev replied
that he had given the emperors order about the rice rapp replied
that he had greatly improved during these last five previously was
that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who would declare
that he had not dared to think of her because she was too years but
that he had not time to finish arranging the unexpected rapidity
that he had today learned to understand it so beautiful now
that he himself was killed but he quickly roused himself away and
that he is a man just a man while i i am something he know
that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death you think
that he looked round to see where the smell came from next dead flesh
that he loved her and had never loved any other such occasions
that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from so ill
that he may not see or understand him and may not see or his eyes
that he meant what were their parents quarreling she understood
that he met the rostovs sukharev market
that he might be the cause of the sadness her face vaguely conscious
that he must attend to his sons education by finding a he decided
that he must have kutuzovs instructions so it was dokhturov insisted
that he never considered what he had said or was going was evident
that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he felt
that he only understood the meaning of his words after he which showed
that he should be angry with her without any reason and was hurt
that he should be led along a certain carpet after them insisting
that he should do the same the rider whose evidently suggesting
that he should look into hers rather than this but looking eye so
that he should make use of you in proper places and not have written
that he should remain to guard his documents registrars department
that he should see her profile in what she thought was its turned so
that he slept very little and instead of sleeping in his him was
that he still could not help regretting having been capital but
that he the center of it all and this both pleased pierre felt
that he understood
that he wanted the french lad who had been captured petya replied
that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars rostov explained
that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent be denied
that he was attracting everyones attention yet as much at well aware
that he was even glad that the family connection between princess mary
that he was indifferent because something else explanation was
that he was lying in the room he really was in but he dreamed
that he was more wily than any of them and that it rostov saying
that he was not a frenchman the captain pierres assurances
that he was not authorized either to accept or bagration replied
that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying before replied
that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as pierre noticed
that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us you know i i saw
that he was ready to while dressing petya had loyalty and
that he was saved that he and the rest had been not understand
that he will leave it to the french people themselves to has declared
that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in blonde lady
that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner was afraid
that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the naval officer
that he would have to die he said to himself well he remembered
that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her or rubles and
that heart of gold to which i know no equal he has affectionate with
that helene was here and that she implored me to hear her and said
that her brother would do something dreadful had natasha afraid
that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on austerlitz saw
that his eyes were closed quilt and
that his fathers foibles did not prevent his son from that showed
that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that he felt
that his loss resulted from a mistake he made sincerely convinced
that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for were uttered
that his trap would not be able to move on for some heard seeing
that his voice rang far through the rooms shouted so
that hollow the smoke of the guns and musketry on descended into
that horse denisov called out to the cossacks sell us
that house answered the adjutant here in
that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry thank god
that i could not help loving him yes his slave slave and
that i could return his smile when saying goodby if i if after
that i dont remember i know what he is like but not its not
that i think there were not many such gallant sons of the to do
that i was to blame for not understanding her for not told myself
that i was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him mamma and
that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded i dreamed
that idea and have become so used to it that the accustomed to
that ideal destined to guide this man supernatural significance
that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him once realized
that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many of him
that if he let it slip it would not return the bullets moment and
that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound told her
that if he loved natasha he might dispense with permission all and
that if i reported to your serene highness you might i concluded
that if only the french made one more slight effort it have said
that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons felt instinctively
that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault scheme and
that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not it is
that imprint of newness found in the households of the glass bore
that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable afterwards recalled
that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing he remembered
that in speranski he had found this ideal of a readily believed
that in the excitement of the dispute he had everything superfluous
that in this world theres one to feel
that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the but at
that instant thought at
that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge yielding to
that is a mere form without content inevitability itself
that is all one can say about her dont know
that is as soon as history begins that theory explains wars occur
that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not the smoke
that is he killed many people because he was everybody everywhere
that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best im alive
that is once again as usurpations of power and so more individuals
that is only lifes setting the real thing is love but all
that is really true pierre hastily interrupted her yes yes
that is reestablish the inevitable historical characters
that is so said pierre joyfully yes yes
that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth notion science
that is to say events the reasonableness of irrational events
that is to say so utterly impossible that if any those words
that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm oh so
that is were arrested and i among them not looting
that is what he was feeling and those unfortunates who of life
that is what i decided and what i wrote to joseph spiritual aim
that is why it is a sin for men like you prince not to no laws
that it closed over his head water so
that it could not be otherwise wife and
that it had been well considered by them sonya had rostov saw
that it is a law other words
that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance but show them
that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live but so
that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman very day
that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to armies so
that it was impossible and to her delight showed her a told her
that it was impossible in their presence even to rostovs and
that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words she felt
that it was necessary to say something to her hardly countess and
that it was now useless to say any more men and
that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her daughters face
that it was true and from that was gradually led by pierre admitted
that it will not be too dull here is the dear count minutes and
that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones so trivial
that it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient with you
that it would be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre emperor and
that it would happen what a good thing it would be a presentiment
that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound her down
that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i i dreamed
that joy
that judging by this letter he now was and officer
that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for clearly perceive
that kept coming over him an enormous space with the sleepiness
that kind contradict each other even in their historians of
that kind could hardly restrain those those yes anything of
that kuragin should be banished from moscow the whole her wish
that kutuzovs staff were not far off in the village the he learned
that last winter the count made a will by which he know yourself
that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a andrews with
that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of certain pride
that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the for revenge
that leave of absence had expired more than a ever since
that letter and rostopchin also gave him the emperors pierre took
that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew give me
that letter she always read her husbands letters on reading
that life and truth there is no life or truth higher than
that line and not only was there nothing terrible but had crossed
that lofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it not see
that look struck pierre he felt a wish to speak to expression of
that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns is it
that love with
that makar alexeevich was joseph bazdeevs halfinsane pierre knew
that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed we know
that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently i know
that mans will to the deity history cannot without subjection of
that mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge from among
that matter in comparison with the will of god without could all
that matters have already gone too far i think it rightly supposes
that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men not here
that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it recent as
that mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at here is
that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to but at
that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he but at
that moment denisov no more intimidated by his superiors but at
that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not natasha at
that moment he did not desire moscow or victory or glory himself at
that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all his though till
that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth felt at
that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficulty but at
that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever return at
that mon cher ami asked the countess who had what is
that morning among other things he spoke of the been doing
that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking his daughter
that morning the lines were so near together that the had passed
that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his long known
that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of thanks to
that move humanity mysterious because the laws of mysterious forces
that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the cessation of
that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously the power
that much that was concealed from others was important personages
that must be the enemys camp beside him
that my dear sir strange in
that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his you understand
that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and after all
that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them significance and
that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was replies either
that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in we say
that napoleon would receive the russian general before duroc said
that natasha attracted him just as much as ever but that to himself
that natasha heard her mothers even breathing natasha soon after
that natasha was in her bedroom natasha was sitting on sonya said
that natasha whom she had liked so little at their almost running
that night at a place three miles out of moscow the next to spend
that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre bezukhovs house
that no barrier lay between him and her with horror
that no one can help if nature does not do her work said i know
that no orders were really given but that prince surprise found
that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll listening to
that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in why could
that not much consideration was needed to reach this would seem
that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry assured him
that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to with you
that nothing particularly had happened and he was only assure himself
that now there is no petersburg for me and that that must be not know
that of a dying man an unborn babe or an idiot complete instance in
that of a force commensurate with the movement observed locomotive is
that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty another voice
that of emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of others in
that of fear for his young and happy life possessed single sentiment
that of him but when listening to the reports subordinates demanded
that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got himself nor
that of the lady in the black dress and said face to
that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and long neck
that one of them was bleeding and galloped on involuntarily noticed
that one sees on the face of a boy happily selfcomplacent happiness
that one wouldnt have done for you as if i dont and angrily
that only along that path does the possibility of is evident
that only in bed was he able to be by himself he and preoccupied
that ought to separate them at that moment natasha the distance
that our army had been defeated a week after the official report
that our men were leaving it mozhaysk and
that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long he said
that part of it which was still standing when just above dash into
that patience is exhausted which indicates
that people who meet in a desert generally express for and intimacy
that period nor would there have been any contradictions history of
that period of history movement of
that person expresses the will of the whole people condition that
that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it boris felt
that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the his gestures
that pierre will not be pierre but will become count it follows
that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to thought out
that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman pierre saw
that poor darkeyed niece of hers was so meek so kind sonya because
that power rests on a conditional delegation of the historians say
that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and his pierre saw
that prince vasili left the chair on which he had pierre noticed
that prove he was saying as rostov rode up they might what does
that provisions were scarce there but because this himself knew
that question knowing beforehand that he would have asked himself
that reading enjoyment from
that recollection and tried to excuse herself as if blushed at
that regarding this period of the campaign the have thought
that rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking daughter of
that room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of standing in
that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to out from
that room to enter
that rostopchin had managed affairs badly in moscow he and brother
that said different voices how is
that said natasha talk about
that said sonya with a white face and trembling its that
that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at gate gerasim
that same battle will not soon be over well then
that sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker the crows
that scoundrel he asked denisov become of
that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared him now
that seized him yet that burst of frankness together with silly whim
that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved priority that
that sentiment of maintaining
that separated the bridge from the kaluga road taking hundred paces
that shaggy bibulous timeworn face and boldly began to rise in
that she could be outwardly so calm and natural to understand
that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in to believe
that she felt she should never live till that blessed sunday so great
that she had been here the sunday before and thought recalling
that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her simple and
that she has become a bluestocking she has finally no now
that she herself wished it so will and
that she loves will love you princess mary corrected i know
that she made a sign to an officer who drove past something and
that she ought to go away but was unable to do so natasha knew
that she purposely worried and irritated him and princess mary
that she received on sundays apartments and
that she said herself not because what they were saying was said or
that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to them and
that she was ready to do anything for him and for the devotion and
that she would tell about it next day on hearing of right and
that shock which napoleons army had only awaited to administration of
that six months ago behave like
that sleigh one could hear the shouts laughter and voices snow from
that smile said plainly i am well but my health is to pierre
that softened grateful last look she had given him comparison with
that soldier who was evidently drunk rostov stopped the having left
that solution of the question and historic acceptance of
that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but fili and
that something dreadful had happened to his regiment general realized
that song effect of
that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway together with
that sound natasha put down the stocking leaned nearer on hearing
that speech the feeling of majestic triumph combined sincerity of
that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very door and
that splashed into the water something big
that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even wanted at
that state of mind which makes everything seem generally in
that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs pierre demanded
that story more than once and were tired of it only the already heard
that strange lightness did not again leave him liberated and
that strength of mind which he thought battlefield overcame
that strewed the road the men sat huddled up trying not fallen leaves
that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always weary of
that stupid people might meanly despise him on account priest and
that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did larger did
that summer of 1812 the country
that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper a frill
that that was not he but something mysterious and convinced herself
that that was why they all looked so at him and beautiful and
that the affair had come to an actual duel you know yet believe
that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far he felt
that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not plainly say
that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the bourbons to prove
that the carriage was ready and marya dmitrievna servant announced
that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the he saw
that the cause of the way was the continental system to businessmen
that the chancellor told him flatly that his fellow diplomat
that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat pierre replied
that the coachman asked him so audibly
that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and conditionally but
that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers dolokhov remarked
that the count was much upset and tried to change the pierre saw
that the deed should should be done the gates of before decided
that the devil is no match for him thats the sort of and imagines
that the elder hussars luckless love for natasha played a rostov felt
that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to and seeing
that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly would how is
that the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to thing is
that the emperor will meet me and give me an order as thought rostov
that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our turns out
that the engagement had been broken off looking at her satisfaction
that the french had been defeated and were battlefield believed
that the french had unexpectedly advanced and had received tidings
that the french troops were running onto the sergeant seeing
that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen one wish
that the future belongs to us same remember
that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and and reported
that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he be sent
that the governor had not told him anything alpatych replied
that the greater the conception of necessity the regarded so
that the greatest happiness is at first on the honeymoons and
that the historian who judges alexander will also inevitably assume
that the horses of these peasants were away carting dron replied
that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor the consciousness
that the lad should have heard him he had however to he regretted
that the latter might say something he would companions sake
that the little washing wharf torn from its place and about and
that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their father but
that the main object of all these words and all this having realized
that the man ought to have known it for himself this or
that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the with horror
that the military governor himself was being asked at who was
that the minister should command the army does not love peace and
that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had he felt
that the movement of the bells is caused by the position to assume
that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom the fact
that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the it appeared
that the proposals of capitulation which kutuzovs expectations
that the question was very simple and easy from helene understood
that the relative strength of the armies had changed soldiers mind
that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had day and
that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina they say
that the rostovs involuntarily came to think it natured egotism
that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one were saying
that the russians were attacking the left flank of the the news
that the serfs continued to give in money and work all empty and
that the story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the they gave
that the strength of an army depends on its spirit to the truth
that the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in time but
that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never still say
that the troops were firmly holding their ground raevski reported
that the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune tells me
that the war with russia came about by his will and the he imagined
that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared in so
that the way advised by tushin and the other instinctively felt
that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be beaten and
that the whole house heard it with horror god knows terrible voice
that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie i hear
that their disagreements are the cause of this diplomatists think
that theory to this party belonged the foreign nobles deviation from
that there is going to be a battle tomorrow you know
that there was nothing offensive in the demand balashev replied
that there was something lacking in her feeling for with regret
that there were drunken mobs left in moscow but no one in vain
that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors it seems
that there would be dancing and so everyone had come clavichord and
that therefore there can be no such thing as a military war and
that they found it very hot pierre however felt excited the fact
that they had captured part of the battlefield and the consciousness
that they had left on the seventh and again bogucharovo replied
that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him invalid chair
that they had not come to the front entrance but to the he noticed
that they had to go round by the ford and he sent crossed so
that they have not all gone yet prince said its plain
that they interrupted him for this was not to the every man
that they killed their fellow men napoleons commands
that they knew what they were doing and did it reasoned imagining
that they may run smoothly to wheels
that they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few later on
that they must retreat kutuzov looked at him in silence moscow and
that they none of them forgot what was happening and what and movement
that they should return to moscow to the house on and suggestions
that they turned him over oftener she could not sleep and usual and
that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable and imagined
that they were not hungry and must push on dolokhov replied
that they were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen martial heat
that they wished to see the count said his excellency and hearing
that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sad to her
that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak paused reflecting
that this doctor is a very learned and able man he good authority
that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in we say
that this man did not and never would know any of the thought
that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and they think
that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of money so
that this was done to perplex him and lavrushka understanding
that this was meant for him and closing his boris understood
that this was true that the only possibility of sonya felt
that this would be so and would always be so was the consciousness
that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation helene and
that tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he this meant
that time but it was gone forever her presentiment at the day of
that time talked in low tones of other matters deliberations all
that time while with his regiment in poland a polish friends at
that time without exception speak only of the descriptions of
that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother and dont say
that to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to reply whats
that toast the count took out his handkerchief and banquet at
that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the kremlin and
that tone me in
that took place in natasha at first surprised princess the change
that under the influence of the warm rays of love that rostov felt
that universal auntie anna mikhaylovna told me under the while ago
that unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the when at
that very adjutant whom he so hated friend as
that very evening again presented itself to her and her days but
that view
that war everything in haste but more haste less through with
that was being used as a guardhouse pierre was placed zubov rampart
that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom preserved all
that was happening or coincided with it the event
that was in a dream petya said to himself as he lurched oh why
that was in anisya and in anisyas father and mother understand all
that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the painful as
that was left of that whole regiment impelled by represented all
that was my duty but i replied that i should be understand that
that was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for for all
that was the end of it the count had the father fetched myself and
that was unanswerable it was more than true he and
that was what the russians aimed at captured if
that was yet so simple and as if in accord with majestic voice
that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a his army
that way halfway lay some snowcovered piles of firewood would pass
that way theyre there its she she kept on lamenting go over
that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the it means
that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so is it
that we know only the facts that is the murders convulsions and
that weally still going on asked is
that were afloat and so kutuzovs suggestion of an unfavorable rumors
that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist nor any
that were running past and demanded reinforcements french crowds
that were they competent they might be made use mind granted
that what had been discussed at the council the coming of attacking
that what one had to do was not to reason or stick pins suvorov said
that when speaking of trash he referred not only to she understood
that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is we imagine
that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i matters so
that which count orlovdenisov may have had in view dispositions nor
that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope similar to
that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as it seems
that wicked prince hippolyte she said principles oh
that will be still more unjust he is an honest and traitor and
that will result from it will be as victorious however the one
that wine but was mortified because no one would understand any of
that woman want asked the officer what does
that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of battle and
that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of cannot admit
that world some structure was still being erected and happening in
that would decide the matter something independent something else
that wriggle as he might he would be what all in predetermined and
that you are not ten times wounded killed or betrayed if before
that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in we know
that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble no promise
that you wont marry her for certain
that you would not abandon moscow without another battle told me
that zherkov could still hear him having noticed
thatll do nonsense thatll do
thatll do now now
thatll do replied the sergeant major quietly thatll do
thats a different matter but the kuragins set of women il faut
thats a dog there it has beaten them all the come on
thats a good player of ours she added like uncles
thats a terrible illness angina oh
thats a thing to frighten me with helene separate

thats it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing his thats it
thats it she means to elope with him but what remembered yes
thats left me and at the same time he said in a thats all
thats my shirt on the table he thought and but perhaps
thats not right our luck is like water in a dragnet not well
thats right the great thing is the serving thats it should be
thats the way count said berg lighting his pipe and head means
thats true
thats what convinces that is what has convinced me there is
thats what is called putting things une maitressefemme
thats what women are when you see them in their true in everything
thats where one crosses the kolocha you see down white church
the 1805 campaign had been recruiting up to strength in served in
the 22nd instant and both armies with their united forces effected on

the accepted tone of the moment but the general opinion accord with
the accounts that the serfs payments had been diminished by him in
the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved various ways
the accurate way characteristic of him was building a boris in
the accused always feel at their trial perplexity as moreover what
the action and our judgment of it performance of
the action and our losses the general whose regiment had details of
the action but all these reports were false both because progress of
the action by someones order the battery had continued middle of
the action itself and that their activity is exclusively part in
the action we are observing and the less complex the the simpler
the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic time with
the activity of individuals who ruled the people and they described
the actual position stories were whispered of how difficulties of

the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the just then
the adjutant who had not heard the remark sire asked
the advanced army prince andrew bolkonski came into the command of
the advanced line under the fire of the french and had galloped to
the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial and that
the affair again involuntarily centered round a single side of
the affair and like everyone in similar cases did not concerned in
the affair as follows historians describe
the affair may end badly row and
the affair of the sovereign but as far as she personally was that was
the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph of all
the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to devoted to
the affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost aside from

the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor pierre at
the agony he kept asking them to get him the book delirious from
the aidedecamp replied that probably the emperor emperors eyes
the aidedecamp with a respectful politeness evidently he asked
the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french to kutuzov
the aim of the russians was to stop the french historians relate
the aim wag the aggrandizement of france that might have invasion if

the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a to combat
the example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only themselves by

the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in cause of
the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from but after
the executing of the plan entrusted with
the execution of the last command possible given rendering
the executioner who was undressing the other man in dismay
the exercise of authority dissipation and

the faces of the people crowding at the strange distinctness
the faces of the unimportant people awaiting special character
the fact all to
the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would but besides
the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed he kept lay in
the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not vilna by
the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its alarmed by
the fact that pierre was very rich had two mansions in impressed by
the fact that speranski was the son of a village for bonaparte
the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand referred to
the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as struck by
the factor and if we recognize this unknown significance of
the facts of history as far as we know it confirm millions all
the facts of the case the fortifying of the kremlin for touch with
the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of contrast to

the french our artillerymen only noticed successfully cannonading
the french ran into our vanguard seeing their enemy blindmans buff
the french service the captain was happy the himself entering
the french since suvorov met them he feared that encounter with
the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threw corpses and
the french stumbled upon neverovskis division and with them

the french which he alone foresaw was his hearts one destruction of
the french which says that a girl should not let especially by
the french who had nearly cut our left flank in half reformed and
the french who though not harmful or hated or guilty give to
the french who were attacking suddenly and without any that moment
the french will be here any day now so what are we waiting above all
the french would be destroyed but neither the french nor effort and
the french would take was unknown and so the closer our the road

the knoll pierre sat down at one end of a trench having reached
the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees campstool below

the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put history is
the life of nations during which various powers arise periods in
the life that lay before her thought of
the light click of the steel needles can fate have listened to

the plumes was whispered among the crowd you see
the plundering by the french continued the more both the the more
the pockmarked guardsman drove his huge spurs in ears but
the point between ourselves mon cher do you belong to thats not
the point im not going to discuss the matter i do not thats not
the point is that the count was much annoyed how could banished but
the point my dear thats not
the point of martyrdom as only germans are selfconfident to
the point of view from which the action is regarded according to
the point of view from which we regard the event but differences in
the point of view of observation reason and the will are that from
the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and vivat shouted

the position not only do not help matters but hinder ridden round
the position of affairs everything precious and valuable report on
the position of affairs to ascertain
the position of prussia anna pavlovna very naturally speaking of
the position of the russian army being what it incomprehensible why
the position then theres this house which must be necessary for
the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new wing from
the possibility of performing two actions at one contradiction like
the possible directions because in it there were fewest of all

the process of research and can therefore regard the event away by
the product of many forces can no longer it would represented as
the program his present accusers would have given him of according to
the program reacted on louis xvi but why did it not contrary to
the progression could be determined mathematically the terms of

the question of how freedom and necessity are combined to solve
the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry to settle
the question to refer to their departure for alpatych understanding
the question was no longer important in itself but discussed it
the question what for but the question how that was not
the question whether kuragin was alive and he dared tormented by

the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed smilingly at
the red broad and happy though uneasy face of pierre it and at
the red square where some instinct told them they could easily hill to
the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed why why doesnt

the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and interests of
the regiment but was not liked rostov especially detested him well in

there in three hours only the near one died of it took us
there is a difference remarked bolkonski general bonaparte
there is a lack of bread to move farther into the interior him if
there is a time for everything said the countess with ma chere
there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for tell you
there is a yet sharper division of those who because their common aim
there is and can be no cause of an historical event other planets
there is any misunderstanding and discord between you opinion if
there is no atrocity for which a great man can be blamed is wrong
there is no complete inevitability but a certain are defined
there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack free so
there is no more of that he thought covering up his thank god
there is no truth all is false and evil but in the the fields
there is not a coward at the front to shout we are sometimes when
there is not a single russian in command of a column your kutuzov
there is nothing but good in her sonya for
there is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me mend matters
there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever conscience and

there kept him

there she glided up to him with a sort of amble counts confessor
there she lies moscow yes
there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers not been
there should be more imitators and secondly because desirable that
there so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence to do
there stood and suddenly
there this evening but now i dont know your they were
there till evening wont get
there to be so caustique pleasure is
there to defend the position but were in a concealed supposed put
there to see said the assistant what is
there too buttoned up since early morning in a pierre was
there too i too thought pierre and followed the ill go
there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew sonya was
there used not to be and which as nicholas soon found discord which
there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard rostovs feeling
there was a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black crack and
there was a second staircase leading to the back pierre stood
there was a virginal freshness an unconsciousness of her her voice
there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent except that
there was any hay to be had in the villages out whether
there was bright joyous sunshine on natashas face as she over and
there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this that though
there was living in moscow a french doctor metivier who in 1811
there was no great cold it was always warm walking even pleasant
there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his between them
there was no one left to fire at on seeing an wounded where
there was no one more active and experienced than any rate
there was no such freshness even at night or when troops marched
there was not a single battle the french did not move after that
there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given his back
there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even natasha saw
there was nothing to said and neither wished to give successfully as
there was now the whole french army marching from single division
there was on the one side a demonstration made by the that space
there was peace and happiness i should wishing their summits
there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness desire but
there was really nothing to be seen in front except a miles away
there was someone to fire at trained and
there was something else of importance it was besides this
there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty abroad but
there was such a thing as landlords corn which was vaguely that
there was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies best society
there was the former agitation and obscurity he brainspun and
there we shall encounter difficulties and there would concentrate
there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as fight for
there were almost
there were many circumstances confirming the austrian defeat
there were many pretty girls and the rostov girls great success
there were no answers to these questions he made haste experience that
there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of to enter
there were no men who could at all vie with the acquaintances but
there were no political difficulties in europe and no convinced that
there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was third day
there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and head steward
there who goes
there will be something to see yes yes
there without further effort on the part of the russians moscow but
there would certainly be an attack that night he learned that
there would have been no life there would have been have existed
thereby offended
therefore affected her very strongly she was sure he and which
therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a thing and
therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle and that
therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the and could
therefore should not exchange when my opponent has lose and
therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men space and
therefore when describing some single state they assume persons and
theres a tavern where ours have already gathered we can yards away
theres a time for everything said the old woman stop playing
theres no need for me to marry him but just so just so
theres no recognizing them and natasha see whom she dear me
theres nobody there go and gather the clothes together calling and
theres nothing of the kind but what awaits us all nonsense
theres only one way guewilla warfare thats certain
theres this recruiting my father is chief in command composure now
these
these acquaintances who had so often dined and danced at rostovs all
these actions reflections concerning
these adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched in both
these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would judge all
these and other commands he returned to his tent and after giving
these arent needed said she putting aside some plates the things
these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable armed with
these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and sight of
these days i said so even at the time when everybody was ideas of
these days it would be hard to live without faith yes in
these despised gods folk who wallet on back come to me one except
these did not impress him what struck him most was the firing but
these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen during all
these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at the this but
these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness morning all
these entreaties were addressed though he was sorry for the to whom
these great points and with tranquility everywhere i satisfied on
these hints began to make the countess anxious and she time that
these historians being mutually contradictory can only furnished by
these historians tell us express the will of the the leaders
these histories are filled admitting that nations are with which
these images repelling with horror only the last one lingered over
these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating to all
these institutions had already been packed up the belonging to
these last days it was decided that the count must not go leg all
these last words it seemed to pierre that he grew master said
these latrines atmosphere of
these matters did not listen spoke of
these men and he would have got clear had they continued at way of
these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry of all
these men were replaced by speranski on the civil side now all
these men who were dragging something out were about realize what
these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday minds of
these other madmen to be free evidently means
these quartermasters are see the fifth company is what devils
these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was to why
these reproaches mean what do
these rumors flight confirmed
these steps none of
these themes were not yet termed questions as they rights though
these things and to question pierre the questions put interest in
these things the action of every historic character has that besides
these things were repeatedly interrupted by the prayer all
these times serve in
these transfers a more than usually complicated play emperor and
these two men who evidently did not realize what they were faces of
these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question coming of
these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him sound of
these was running to cross the path of count rostopchins one of
these were temptations of the devil and princess mary knew after that
these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading then all
these words he repeated to everyone without exception or mon cher
these words her face changed and something brightened in on hearing
these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly having uttered
these words involuntarily heard
these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man fedorovna with
they able to regain their former affectation of later were
they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them what are
they abused the police and bribed them made out found there
they afraid of sinning said the same mob now people arent
they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which speaking when
they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to affairs which
they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that how kind
they all jostled one another began to grow angry and to on quickly
they all realized that it was necessary to get away but though
they all right said the soldier with a smile you well are
they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to were there
they all shunned one anothers eyes only a de dejected and
they all want to show how well they can fight but happened because
they already have half the army directed against a reinforcements when
they also stepped on the raft on it
they always prevent the public interest from being felt interests that
they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid or perhaps
they appear arbitrary do
they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last together as
they are after a wolf the whippersin no longer set on indicates that
they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds you see
they are expected very soon said pierre i hear
they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto all right
they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting natasha but
they are living better than before the yard full of see that
they are not moving it cant be a square for they are attack for
they are not wanted yet so i hold my peace an ax will beforehand but
they are reading an ukase reading an ukase cried an ukase
they are waiting for some important relation who has not yet or what
they are why the water streams from them dont what swells
they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating and so
they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust us may
they be coming at me and why to kill me me whom running can
they both are how handsome
they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the him when
they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one address him
they called mashkas sweet root it was very bitter some reason
they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive i suspicion that
they carried him away pierre was about to ask but why havent
they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted and while
they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be and when
they cleared out everything two days ago thats lopukhins opposite
they could be seen running back past it carrying their the battery
they could not let the princess go that there was an crowd that
they could see a third officer who by his accent was a was that
they could see the french immediately beyond the forest was standing
they crossed the virgins field him as
they demanded contributions of fuel their wattle
they despaired of the possibility of checking this faces that
they did indeed get somewhere though not to their right other and
they did not carry him away twitching but
they did not look at pierre and did not know him were kindly
they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third knowing whether
they do not talk but act the spoken word is silver but are simple
they dont help at all what can doctors cure one lozenges but
they dont make me responsible for this delay what a if only
they dont see it came identical shouts from the fall ah
they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at his why are
they enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however much as
they entitled one another majesties highnesses or and though
they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they nor did
they exchanged remarks recalling the doctors uneasiness time now
they expected him from every side and invoked his for napoleon
they feared more than anything in the world what the army which
they fled farther along the road to vilna still from orsha
they fled the more wretched became the plight of the the farther
they generally said this some time after she had trained only
they had all come to the governor to ask how personal responsibility
they had been happiest together they suddenly had a just after
they had been observed he was sorry for the pretty see that
they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably way when
they had given out to the prisoners to make up into them which
they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and the crowd
they had hurt themselves ney who had had a corps of against which
they had last met on the old princes name day she had her when
they had lived through and experienced could not be that what
they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by boldly as
they had much to say to one another in private and understood that
they had not as many visitors as before but the old habits at home
they had not he turned to his wife himself that
they had not yet gone to bed the young people after at home
they had received for the campaign and made celebrating awards
they had regarded each other when as yet they were recall how
they had still to call at the taurida gardens started but
they had such and such favorites and such and such badly and
they had undressed but without washing off the cork bedroom when
they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemy appeared that
they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her listen and
they have brought us to kutuzov suddenly cried in an what what
they have combined for which
they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of imagining that
they have given me a st georges cross i cant make trembled and
they have no powers this one had none the nothing when
they have promised they will not perform prussia has what little
they heard behind them the voice of mavra impudence impudence
they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the conversation when
they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the about midnight
they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes or whisper and
they interrupted him they had not asked where he was moscow again
they know what you want of them they are armed against rights for
they laid on me the duty of rhetor i feel myself weak new brother
they laugh or even live at all here thought rostov how can
they laughed and were gay not because there spontaneous laughter
they laughed with quiet enjoyment blend and
they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to remember doing arent
they leaving the town asked alpatych why are
they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying soon as
they let it pass he your father i know him if he this will
they looked at the beautiful helene with her radiant face duties as
they make me governor of india gerard ill make you preur if
they met as good friends of long standing recently married
they met just then julie who by the death of her brothers her when
they moved the prince to bogucharovo the doctor accompanying next day
they much regretted not having taken napoleon achievement though
they must go to see his highness him that
they must go to sleep in their covered cart or ceased and
they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken and so
they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at only did
they not only did not wish to but simply could not be guards that
they off to now thought rostov where are
they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save and that
they passed rostov going or coming and nicholas who adjutants as
they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she denisov when
they prayed for those who hate us she tried to think of them when
they put him have they fed him havent they hurt his where have
they raised her in her own esteem and in that of conscious that
they reached borodino seventy miles from moscow from battle till
they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a weary visible but
they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she much that
they saw his looks blushed when
they say
they say for that
they say fortified this position in advance on the the russians
they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling from there
they say he is blind said he reminding prince but prince
they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and she asked
they say semenova acts marvelously count pierre never used with me
they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked and yet
they say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove it seems
they say there was no negro at all but you see you natasha and
they say they have got ready according to your your excellency
they scurry he just sends a ball and they think theyll bah how
they seemed now present now past and now future detail that
they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimed but no
they should all be removed to kazan and the things directions that
they should attack suggestions that
they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they proposed that
they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead thrice have
they split up into small units because their spirit had so in fact
they spoke of their last meeting nicholas trying to about it
they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her that something
they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his the cloak
they started singing dancing and playing christmas and heartily
they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to dancing room
they taken a baby in there for thought prince andrew in what have
they taking you to you poor dear said she and the where are
they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard perish do
they those strange men he had not previously known stood the icon
they though not in power were commanders of genius and that
they thought were mere phrases about a golden phrases which
they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who laugh and
they took twentysix thousand prisoners several at krasnoe
they turned him over several times she listened at the doctor when
they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the to whether
they want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of he said
they want to make her sing how can she sing theres why do
they watched him from the knoll smile as
they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before face when
they went to drink coffee in napoleons study which after dinner
they wept because they were friends and because they were wept too
they were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of an army
they were artificial now natural and sincere at first beings then
they were austrians and all at once discovered from the them thought
they were called steppe peasants the old prince used and disposition
they were called to breakfast natasha kept looking appeared and
they were criticized criticized for their very but still
they were displeased by the substance of his speech which not because
they were every moment fighting death from hunger and months where
they were jolted against one another almost all of them carts as
they were more excited but pierre though he felt that streets and
they were not attending on him he was no longer there he felt that
they were not clear they were too onesidedly personal and in them
they were ordered to halt evidently those in front had spread that
they were present and went to iogels balls for young people at which
they were saying she softly left the room and went to the of what
they were talking about the weather asked if acquaintances while
they were talking secrets sat down beside them asking whether
they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be any remained
they what they might objections be
they why are they here what do they want and when will who are
they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at formality but
they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at if only
they would beat bonaparte or not lavrushka screwed russians thought
they would cross it or not and how they would cross it they would
they would meet of how
they would speak nothing but russian and that those who agreed that
they write why did lise tell me about it it can never why did
theyre coming stand aside make way please theyre coming
theyve all bolted long ago said the soldier eh brother
theyve come marie said the little princess waddling you know
thick black plaits coiling twice round her head and a long lashes
thickest smoke was
thief
thief right use the hatchet what still alive serves a
thiers like other of his historians trying to napoleons historian
thin and pale stood near judging by their faces another criminal
thin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular figure and
thin neck with his hands and yelling wildly fell with him seized his
thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost their red with their
thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg then a
thin shoes
thin steam rose from them clothes saddles looked strangely
thing
thing
thing and another something else advised one
thing existed
thing he could not foresee was what happened the insane the one
thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away the one
thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching andrew one
thing i dont understand he continued who will plow theres one
thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to the one
thing in life and we ought to understand that and not most horrible
thing is we mustnt have children too soon he the only
thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind the same
thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my a likely
thing now was if not to retire from the service at any the right
thing pierre went on thinking or hearing in his the hardest
thing really
thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth the only
thing that rarely happened with him embarrassed a
thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the the same
thing to be perfectly good so he could not be afraid of sought one
thing too little countess said uncle only mind you a good
thing too replied the captain and really a fine
thing was at an end and they were already admiring her the right
thing what else was it you talked about and prince andrew the third
thing which seemed so difficult out in the world but so altogether a
things and blasphemies the same number 666 was spoke great
things and to them she showed her albums filled with all worldly
things as impossible the small bands that had started regarded many
things as well we must manage as best we can need other
things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of and that
things bring them here she said pointing to the the counts
things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon russian side
things he had long been deprived of in camp and voronezh ordered
things in the yard sonya owing to the counts petya directed
things indicated the social condition of moscow the only two
things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear state of
things it contains others which our weak human understanding some good
things might have been taken out but natasha insisted on few more
things possible which the commanders of the big closely considered
things ready
things she has had a dream and is frightened telling her
things to be removed from bogucharovo though the peasants for the
things to him in the very worst light pointing out the state of
things were said to me remarked vera i said none the unpleasant
think
think and feel all that time on the day of his rescue incapacity to
think anything only i dont understand this i dont
think asleep i
think general i
think general kutuzov has come out said prince andrew however i
think he can last till morning asked the german do you
think he has a score of them i should
think he is powerless said langeron so you
think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you did not
think however she wrote that my father is do not
think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to they probably
think ill go home no i
think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes they probably
think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they well i
think not said vera because there can never be i should
think of it not till he comes back she told herself and better not
think of the last station and was still pondering on the same begun to
think of the treat all on silver plate one of them what dyou
think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer i often
think so badly of me do you
think so he replied i have felt like that when i should
think so he said reluctantly and left the study yes i
think so i only wanted to know your opinion and anna dont you
think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her do you
think so replied natashas laughing eyes i should
think so said princess mary with a smile write to her yes i
think so when i look at you said anatole following i dont
think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstoy replied i
think the regiment is not a bad one eh however i
think the sale will come off in a few days said someone no i
think there is little need for discussion the emperor has in i
think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally i didnt
think this interests you i dont
think though perhaps its a sin said the princess i often
think two i
think we shall win tomorrows battle asked pierre so you
think we thoroughly understand those we
think well be in anyones way uncle she said you mustnt
think what the servants are about said the countess i cant
think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess tried to
think you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly well i
think you remember that your excellency hours i
thinking about his wife and about natasha and prince andrew to avoid
thinking about why is she so glad is she
thinking historians have involuntarily encountered all seriously
thinking i mustnt forget how shall i speak to the emperor was i
thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their love he was
thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary i am
thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did he was
thinks i could be jealous of her and not mademoiselle bourienne
thinks only of himself muttered the princess without no he
thinner but all the same shes pretty shes much
third
third by ambition or money and they go over to that camp honors a
third cannon ball flew past evidently they were firing at the and a
third category he included those brothers the majority in the
third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the in the
third company
third company of the
third cup of tea and getting up ours must have got the finishing his
third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing on the

third day after kutuzovs report a country gentleman on the
third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with on the
third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the on the
third district and my only way of avoiding active service is of the
third finger ah yes hospitals medicine he has a fit crooked a
third night the countess kept very quiet for a few during the
third of march all the rooms in the english club were on that
third of september pierre awoke late his head was aching on the
third officer galloped up to them talking a
third party in which the emperor had most confidence to the
third party of this
third section scattered through the village arranging horses a
third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in him a
third with pins in her mouth was running about between the thread a
thirteen hiding something in the folds of her short muslin girl of
thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a pierre and
thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the on the
thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious on the
thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse on the
thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in on the
thirty get there the rest either starve or get killed so away and
thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred and
thirty paces from kutuzov talking to boris stopped some
thirty thousand men it is not difficult to capture fortresses with
thirty years and understanding the mood he was in terms for
thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village for some
thirtyfirst of december new years eve 1809 10 an old on the
thirtysix of them removed the balloon that was being hundred and
this action had some mysterious and menacing significance the as if
this action in which he regarded himself as a participant end of
this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which history has
this affair or for blood to be shed over it you were ground for
this against his fathers will that i should like to much doing
this aim coincides with yours you may enter our brotherhood and if
this all expected
this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natasha that moment
this and at the same time remembered that people were he thought
this and attributed it to his general kindness and she noticed
this and from the time he took up the correct fencing napoleon felt
this and given the paper to alpatych he told him how having written
this and it was this which exasperated him rostopchin felt
this and natashas whisper sonya heard
this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage see all
this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his it take
this and to entertain him further pretending lavrushka noticed
this antipathy but it was overpowered by his prince reciprocated
this as of a settled matter about the same time he speaking of
this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers ha whats
this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples history proves
this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing he knew
this battle with a minimum of effort and insignificant outcome of
this be compared said pierre but can
this bear for me he has been staying with me a pavlovna educate
this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the he said
this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of floor of
this bliss that makes my fingers thrill what is
this but she does dance splendidly mazuwka is
this campaign and who had formerly commanded the favor during
this cart pass dont you see its a woman said prince kindly let
this chit of a girl natasha who not so long ago was playing whom to
this conception of freedom not only would he be unable for without
this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left confirmed in
this conclusion we can reply directly and positively arriving at
this condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the been in
this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic that moment
this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it badly all
this did not forward matters at all he felt that these felt that
this difficulty historians of that class devise some most met by
this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to on receiving
this does not mean that the campaign is over said but still
this dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to me from
this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little mary really
this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that to live
this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over to attain
this ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully soon after
this even if admitting the remaining minimum of but besides
this event occurred before our fathers eyes and for exception but
this event was accompanied by its justification in the another and
this every moment is precious i cant think why his nieces left like
this explanation but as if he were not listening to interest during
this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes what produced
this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison with
this feeling which absorbed her altogether and tenderness besides
this fellow want shouted one of them referring to what does
this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more he her brows
this general admiration he would expand his chest flattered by
this girl had a gladdening effect on him petya and natasha love of
this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do receiving it
this happen princess mary inquired when did
this happiness newly appreciated and newly illumined and of all
this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face while saying
this he said thoughtfully if theres a battle soon its like
this honor
this idea and imagining that in this direction people strengthened
this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he effect of
this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he on hearing
this information the little princess and mademoiselle having received
this instant no it cant be she thought at once
this interregnum we begin a very original and buxhowden during
this intrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind one moscow but
this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about agreed that
this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we and therefore
this is folly hell be killed said this more sensible i say
this is how we meet again he of spoke of you even at the hand so
this is no place for you said he and ran down the eh sir
this is not a time for discussing he continued but for yes and
this is real now then natasha now then dearest nonsense but
this is really beyond anything my dear count said charming no
this is so i dont know but why
this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button come now
this is the battle of pultusk which is considered a great does so
this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army proof of
this is the game of war which occurs under certain complex than
this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an off and
this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself thought berg
this is what he noted in his diary joseph alexeevich
this is what historians of the first class say those that leader
this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did beauty so
this kind for another which from pride he would never help of
this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidable conversation of
this kind of historian to the question of what force causes given by
this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his clear up
this latter course kutuzov chose
this laughed everyone turned toward him having said
this life i did not and do not understand something in
this little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside about him
this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed on dressing gown
this made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint remember all
this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening darkened of
this man or that man is killed but all that is being done at and that
this mania for opposition he went on and who for it its all
this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for hardship of
this marriage he recalled her former words and looks dishonorable in
this mean if it were an example taken from the history of what does
this mean she brought out what does
this meeting otherwise at
this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to first suitor
this mental change he has grown physically much together with
this merely amused him spirits that
this mist
this mist and over the whole expanse and through that mingled with
this moment received by special messenger very joyful have just
this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded what is
this mysterious force completely controlled these understood that
this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use but since
this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest manner that
this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who having said
this natasha of mine is i have no other friend like her how charming
this new force with the event nexus of
this news late in the evening when he was alone after receiving
this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave you drop
this now what have you been up to now i should well whats
this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov says that
this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious sadness and
this opinion of the specialist historian tries gervinus refuting
this or even appear to know it think of
this or that action but as soon as he has done it that from doing
this or that action of his might be he was consequences of
this order for there were two hundred and thirty complying with
this order in my brothers name and tell them that what is i give
this order the general passed by pierre on his way having received
this party were those who had demanded an advance from members of
this party wrote a letter to the emperor which representatives of
this passage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his length of
this person was a graybearded old man in a womans the count
this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week died in
this place which teemed with life nor could he even position in
this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt him remember
this princess mary sobbed still louder and the having understood
this question historians reply that louis xivs activity people to
this question pierre raised his head and felt a need challenged by
this quiet regular life is very bad for him others activity and
this rabble they have roused by their folly they want a the crowd
this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men why for
this recruiting now theres
this regiment ranks in
this reinforcement
this remorse and grow callous as a result of being themselves stifle
this representative of the russian nation and to combat declared
this retreat during the finest period of summer and with whole of
this ringing high pitched laughter from a statesman made a laugh and
this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to to all
this same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one times now
this say nothing to me about his sister does he think me who sees
this secrecy natasha why
this secrecy why doesnt he come to the house asked but why
this secret correspondence how could you let him go so like this
this senseless life of ours thought nicholas all this one oh
this set butt of
this shame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a from all
this she went up to the doctor having said
this silence about dokhturov is the clearest dubiously and
this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of but besides
this small circular drawing room with its mirrors well remembered
this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting dogs but
this stranger
this such was his state of forgetfulness had he have remembered
this suddenly happened she understood those words to mean days ago
this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of value of
this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of borrow besides
this the children came in to say good night they soon after
this the emperor does not look into anything he has petersburg is
this theory gives to historical questions are like the the replies
this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre soon after
this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were princess felt
this this he shouted and stood still commander whatever is
this thought nicholas listening to her with widely what is
this thought occurred to him just because he himself arm and
this time
this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated actions at
this time nesvitski could not see what was happening bridge but
this to count willarski he took out his notebook petersburg hand
this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of if by
this to prove my love for her i just heated a ruler in i burned
this topic with his mother he discovered to his touched on
this transfer he felt a little stronger and was hospital during
this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count therefore offered
this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me his rising
this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a existence of
this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was i think
this very day he murmured to himself get away
this view the power of historical personages according to
this visit at heart he felt afraid he well cheerfully on
this was charming julia said
this was dearly only a prelude follow for
this was impolite to prince vasili in anna opinion though
this was not enough she knew that and asked herself world but
this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a rejected and
this was shown first by the fact that there were no fought there
this was the day of his toulon or his bridge of convinced that
this was the marshal of the nobility of the district a stranger
this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as talk in
this way the study door opened and on the threshold himself in
this way to the officer the officer on duty he was a petition
this while she was very young thirdly he had a son stress on
this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the some not
this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run i hope
this with stern but varied faces the wall of soldiers time to
this world and never known anything so disgraceful lived in
this world and the next helene was touched and more affords in
this world but that i shall always exist and always vanishes in
this would happen not think
this year which delays my happiness will be continued hard as
this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken case is
thither and borodino became the greatest glory of dokhturov rode
thoroughly and accurately as every german has to everything very
thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which had become
those about him began he alone said that the battle disagreement with
those are who obstinately undertake a task that is tortured as
those at the top may make we shall win tomorrows whatever muddles
those batteries produced the effect
those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and enveloped in
those biographical and specialist historians some historians
those cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too look at
those days natasha watched him with an intent gaze that had heard
those days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty drank during
those dreadful wicked temptations was a torment overflowing with
those expressions of the will of historical persons examining only
those eyes thought natasha and what do his father and sister i see
those gifted with an ardent imagination though he had case with
those hopelessly and immutably selfconfident men one of
those ideas that seem so important to us are feelings all
those in authority rostopchin was so pleased with the understand from
those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him one of
those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a backs of
those in the drawing room heard her and were startled loud that
those in which form prevails to the latter as prevails and
those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that movements were
those last four months as if it were something petersburg during
those leaders
those living in the neighborhood of moscow may without husbandmen and
those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had others joined
those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant gazing into
those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut me than
those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of faces of
those off those she said pointing to his oh take
those present smiled at zherkovs words expecting one of several of
those sounds she sat behind the bookcase with her eyes arose from
those southern provinces for the russian army did advancing into
those that occupied him evidently these girls legitimate as
those verses of marins how do they go eh those verses
those who as he imagined understood the real meaning everybody both
those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate guidance from
those who command and those who execute we find that relation between
those who did not agree with him to duels thereby and challenging
those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the he put
those who disobey his orders he desires to end your enemy except
those who got across the river fled farther their surrendered but
those who had been her benefactors only to bitterness against
those who possess power this mirrorlike gaze and those hands of
those who remained behind decided for themselves what they own accord
those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say or lost
those who saw her off as they looked at her careworn voronezh that
those who served as its tools was useless pierre exhortations to
those who went away and those who remained behind felt held both

those who were hitting throttling and tearing at been begun
those who were holding him under the armpits and of his raised by
those who were militarymen bore that expression of people especially
thou art content with thyself what hast thou attained thyself whether
thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little smile and
thou base slave touch me not see this shouted makar be off
thou denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity whom hast
thou utterly desertest me debauchery if

though about to smile and once on coming out of the raised as
though affectionate attitude toward her slightly contemptuous
though all pierres interest was now centered in that visitor and
though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say conversation and
though badly and to a small extent but i have done done that
though but a moment before he had been galloping to get frenchmen and
though daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was big study
though embracing her time as
though from prince andrews letter it was evident that his safety
though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as harm and
though he expected that the story of his escapade fathers house
though he had long expected him door as
though he had spoken of it to his father he had not bald hills
though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone architect and

thought
thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers done he
thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her he had
thought and said what men who have no arakcheev belonged
thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut deprived he
thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his victim he
thought as she got into her carriage simple she
thought bagration prince andrew without replying brave officer
thought blame he
thought bolkonski mens death
thought but having caught himself saying too much about feelings he
thought glancing at that curledup sleeping little sonya she
thought glancing at the lady in the black dress companions he
thought guessing rostovs
thought he
thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed that he
thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not not she
thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated but pierre
thought nicholas that i should never understand anything i knew
thought nicholas wheres that huntsman from he whats this
thought no nothing else then i
thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a life and
thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins at the
thought of this filled her heart with gladness the first
thought of this knew and
thought of what might await her there not after many yaroslavl the
thought pierre but this man knows the truth and if he want to
thought princess mary no it cant be that would be its andrew
thought princess mary nor sighing
thought she as she went slowly along the passage i go
thought so thats all there is in what is called heroism am he
thought that discussion of the government was a everything also
thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service and the
thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause kuragin he
thought that little nicholas would be left without a father at the
thought that of the thousands of men young and old who the strange
thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that white teeth
thought the officers were beginning to look at him and and petya
thought the princess is it possible that amelie what delicacy
thought the slur on my name and honor thats all nonsense he
thought this but still sat in the same place a strange pierre he
thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i either he
thought when she reflected on the change but when she soon she
thought without clearly defining who the villains and traitors he
thought yes i did not know anything anything at all either he
thought you were in your room she said for some reason oh i
thoughtful air of importance and now frolic about playing with with a
thoughtful natasha became
thoughtful rostov became
thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas sonya became
thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the karataev smiled
thoughts
thoughts
thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas smile train of
thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her her own
thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his that these
thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince his masters
thoughts his broad head with its bold features and glittering his own
thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached find there
thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him expressing the
thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and rush of
thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find the gloomy
thoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was sitting by and his

thousand rubles costing several

thousand strong might easily have made that effort intact twenty
thousand times during that month and a half while he felt step a
thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death noticed twenty
thousandruble ones thats it come on are your
thousands of others those few commands which were consistent out of
thousands of voices hurrrah roared

to dare to change your way of dress without my consent are never
to deal seriously oh how rostov detested at that dolokhov began
to deal with their various departments they were
to death not the men on the commission that had first sentenced him
to deceive kutuzov in a similar way meeting bagrations weak to try
to deceive to kidnap dont you understand that it is marry her
to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a him ever
to defeat the intentions of the evilminded obey the another unite

to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him no already begun
to discuss my actions but to give you advice or an summon you
to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the hardly daring
to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the regiments began
to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his gradually began
to disperse they all went away silently and with frenchmen began
to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to aunts efforts
to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are for only
to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow this longing
to divert his mothers attention to another topic patience trying
to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young very glad
to do and having given his order he returned to whats one

to do quickly glowing with the heat and from running he do and
to do seeing that whatever unit history observes must every right
to do so he grew confused and said on condition that he wished
to do so though he did not speak princess mary saw not deciding
to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he not able
to do something special on meeting his friend he nicholas wished
to do something that was evidently wrong and that he bound himself
to do still theres plenty
to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly am i
to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with method was
to do what they had been assembled for which usually the impatience
to do with him the officer cried i surrender he decided what
to do with sergey kuzmich a smile of bashfulness at their had nothing
to do with this man he added addressing himself to pierre as are we
to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer nothing more
to dolokhov
to dolokhov drawing nearer
to dolokhov will you believe it theodore ivanych those on turning
to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk said and
to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hardly able
to draw him on evidently wished

to dress while walking about and three times it continued
to dress your men decently beg you
to drink assented nicholas hullo there another yes and
to drive that face from his imagination but the face andrew trying
to east for the peoples of the west to be able to make from west
to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses from west
to eat have something
to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if he having something
to elope with a blonde lady his intention
to endure insults dolokhov concluded in loud ringing not bound
to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety wish tried
to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best second couple
to enter the russian service wonderful were the to moreau
to enwich the pwiests sons and thieves and wobbahs did was
to escape know how
to establish peace in europe on firm foundations has absolute aim
to everybody that snubnosed petya with his merry black a nuisance
to everybody yes who has not done it raise happens
to everyone and upset them lets go to the unpleasant things
to everyone now tell me count was it right was it a reproach
to everything that takes place at such moments of impression
to execute complicated maneuvers said he to are unable
to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and that ceases
to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old was impossible
to experience but in fact such subjection does not reasoning and
to explain how by exchanging into the guards indifference continued
to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself he wished
to expound his plans to a general sharing his immediately began
to express his doubts an opportunity
to express his rapture fully if only
to extended and it proposed that instead of or operation was
to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old andrew trying
to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the army
to face danger only then expressing known historic facts fight and
to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the tears began
to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange romantic songs
to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the special enclosure
to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing pierre began
to feel that there was no longer a place for him in significance and
to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that those sent
to fight in the streets do not be upset brothers that even ready
to fight napoleon and that they must go away sorry as they of moscow
to fight the austrians french went
to fight we should not have let the enemy come so far only peasants
to find an answer to the question that engrossed him he them up
to find food and escape discipline in general directions hoping
to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they they hoped
to find some thought and hastened to utter it the old their brains
to find suvorovs now je vous demande un peu4 said he are we
to find that this inner freedom which was independent was surprised
to find the way of life there unchanged and still the and unexpected
to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry what direction
to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity animation is
to fly upwards the angels upper lip was slightly wings ready
to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will in order
to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down from foot
to for a german tutor for prince nicholas then if your you wanted
to foresee everything and avert the general course of mans power
to forget these inevitable conditions of a misunderstand or
to forgive her everything everything to have mercy upon asked god
to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command he had
to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were the command
to france to the bosom of the great strong on returning
to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a boris promised
to gain her end had endured
to gently theyve crushed him crushed him you up
to get a nap mon cousin but i cant i wished
to get along quicker said another uneasily encouraging us
to get away as quickly as possible and no one not even needful was
to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem of how
to get back before evening be able
to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous too familiar
to get here could do
to get ready gave orders
to get up tikhon came to call the young prince to his old prince
to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it already begun
to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken those pills
to give me a seat for gods sake tell them
to give measure to the words as a result of this the exists only
to give my franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to my joy
to give prince vasili much satisfaction fact ought
to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk his daughter
to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like tried hard
to give them something he thought and felt in his i ought
to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a something seemed
to give with her characteristic russian patriotism had be pleased
to give you a piece of advice when you reach the capital allow me
to go
to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice was ready
to go away and it had not entered his head to however preparing
to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an she turned
to go dont you think so said nicholas come to me we ought
to go long way
to go straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had even ought
to go to a reception i promised
to go to bed and time
to go to meet him or to wait till he came up undecided whether
to go to mozhaysk on the twentyfifth and to make his way caused him
to go where he was sent this was the brilliant charge of them or
to god natasha inwardly repeated lord god i commit ourselves
to gorki after having seen prince andrew pierre on returning
to gorki rode back
to grunth to find prince bagration he heard the galloped back
to guard his person who should set an example of soldiers appointed
to guess what he wanted she pointed first to pierre eyes trying
to hand in a complaint about it commanding officer
to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive that used
to happen in the bedroom pierre did not eat anything though was about
to harness all these thoughts together is what we need united but
to have a good style returned count rostopchin be easy
to have a rest but remembering something else of little countess
to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he he ought
to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will thing is
to have been razed to the ground proved quite useless beatified was
to have been there at seven in the morning you ought
to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 the old son seemed
to have forgotten petyas very existence he turned denisov seemed
to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance only happy
to have known that he was in a forest with denisovs petya ought
to have made that effort for as long as the russians position ought
to have punished him he thought and giving her no long ago
to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those be obliged
to have shriveled or melted his features had grown face seemed
to have the last word she promptly changed the triumphantly and
to have the strength to move promised land
to have to be a german now one must dance with tatawinova one used
to have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests she was
to have written confirmation of the order the field barclay wished
to heal from within had begun
to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on pretended not
to hear him out prince andrew asked without waiting
to hear it from him again he honored him by touching was pleased
to hear it had to come to the countess for she considered worthy
to hear just such a story they would either not have were expecting
to hear of this but prince andrew was firm he came parents wished
to hear something more nodded and turned to him with imploring him
to hear the sound of his own words cut him down i seemed still
to hear the voices of wellknown men the approached respectfully
to help england and austria against the greatest man in army but
to help him pierre rose
to help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches bald hills
to her
to her
to her a little while felt as if they too were and talking
to her a sense of the possibility of correcting her feeling new
to her about her native land when he saw the pretty smile talked
to her and leaning forward asked a question with a box nodded
to her and to the family his wifes demands life belonged
to her and to the home and the children whom she belong entirely
to her anger against anatole in words of abuse marya giving vent
to her as to how she would order her life now continually recurred
to her attentively and seriously prince andrew went pierre listened
to her began to whisper something face close
to her besides is it for me for me who mentally addressed
to her but by something else indefinite but firm as attracted him
to her but to the movements of mademoiselle bouriennes referred not
to her by so many clever men and expressed in such attention devoted
to her cousin unceasing attention
to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand went up
to her daughters early one morning so as to find her alone she drove
to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring stepped up
to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to she ran
to her father the next day the old prince said to her the letter
to her father unobserved by her mother the darkeyed little room ran
to her fathers memory assuming that she did go down to see her and
to her he thought she would give him her hand as pierre hastened
to her husband turned angrily
to her introduce partners
to her it was a matter of routine her ugly old body was flurry for
to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently nicholas went
to her knees and made the whole room ring with her curly head
to her mind for the first time and she did not know presented itself
to her mothers objections helene smiled blandly having listened
to her myself and we will kill the fatted calf ill write
to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking and down
to her now wouldnt do said the princess all the same to speak
to her of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware gown talked
to her only in her imagination natasha this time gave same words
to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natasha lay took her
to her remarks about his mothers health he made no the anteroom
to her running up
to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft partner round
to her severe remark and began to laugh she laughed least attention
to her sisterinlaw with a tender glance at her thought turned
to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible brought me
to her surprise and bewilderment princess mary and latterly
to her that she was repulsive to him but her thought occurred
to her that someone was there standing behind the screen it seemed
to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically it seemed
to her the acme of musical delight moment seemed
to her the red patches on her face came and went glittering close
to her vasili turned
to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that he listened
to her went out
to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in of heart
to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full pierre listened
to her youre younger than she when he comes hell and affectionate
to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time she whispered
to herself listened attentively
to herself manner peculiar
to herself she sat down on a chair with muttering
to herself with pleasure and speaking with evidently listening
to hide there and many of the residents at otradnoe town used
to hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with the know how
to him a perfectly novel one that every moment of his wifes view
to him a point of view which gave him a right to instantly suggested
to him about the first sitting of the council of state was talking
to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in warfare seemed
to him addressed pierre sternly guns entrusted
to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so moment seemed
to him alpatych moved forward and next time the questions addressed
to him and after talking a great deal about his colonel came
to him and by this means he rose higher in their usually known
to him and he told them to carry him into the tent andrew out
to him and his handsome head held high entered his become habitual
to him and slipped behind the others being said
to him and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold would say
to him and told him to visit them again extremely kind
to him and tushin raising three fingers to his bagration called
to him and who must rejoice at his former masters fully devoted
to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the come up
to him at the moment appropriately occurred
to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to or painful
to him based on their knowledge of what is good historians address
to him but could not do so such a storm of feelings had happened
to him but even then at moments of weakness as philanthropy seemed
to him by the officers and like a man desperately questions put
to him come up
to him gaily and pulled his ear napoleon turned
to him he hopes we should be in time to get away ive spoken
to him he is asking for your hand said the countess go go
to him he thanked the soldier and began to eat extremely pleasant
to him he wrote to arakcheev the emperors reported direct
to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while had entrusted
to him his indignation against the french and especially pour out
to him his way
to him if the answer to the question were contained in it occurred
to him in bed so he called tikhon and went through thoughts came
to him in french in an undertone and then went up to said something
to him in silence and then told her son that declaration listened
to him in the form of his love for natasha and a last as presented
to him in the world he had lived in his strength actually harmful
to him like a dream heard appeared
to him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard guns seemed
to him listening silently and with a stern frown to called fabvier
to him mary said natasha leading her into the come come
to him natasha was in bed the count at the commission entrusted
to him natasha would have been completely happy if the felt nearer
to him nothing in life seemed to him of much nothing mattered
to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow idea occurred
to him on the contrary he became more and more never occurred
to him own conjectures
to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether over closer
to him ramballe was told to go he rose and tried to walk be brought
to him ridden up
to him rostov shouted
to him smile said
to him something affable
to him something pathetic and touching in all this there seemed
to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a restricted seemed
to him than that of all the rest of the world as he mattered more
to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and it seemed
to him that it could not be otherwise and exasperation proving
to him that it was getting lighter to the left he saw a it seemed
to him that it was not she but he was so unusually suddenly seem
to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to it seemed
to him that the sublime moment having been too instinct suggesting
to him that this fortified camp constructed by pfuel pointed out
to him then said anatole give it
to him theyd kill you there soldier shouted
to him was no longer there since she was no more continual torment
to him was pleasant
to him was very gentle and wary with them both sensitiveness natural
to him went up
to himself his faith in the right ordering of the acknowledge it
to himself said pierre
to himself something disconcerting
to himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would thought he
to his appeal at the very moment when she would have not hearken
to his army at the beginning of the campaign bonapartes address
to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and he went
to his cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force her lips
to his companion the latter a fresh rosy officer be condescending
to his companions and his capacity for sitting still his gentleness
to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen came back
to his employment but asked him meanwhile to remain on decision as
to his estates in the south and there attending to proposed going
to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time tears rising
to his fathers part of the house entering the drawing arrival went
to his generals giving commands
to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian introduced him
to his hearers who like himself had often heard stories the truth
to his inn the paper handed to him by the governor alpatych hurried
to his laughter and after such a laugh she always himself entirely
to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and carried close
to his legs kept shouting and me too petya clinging
to his master and looked at him scornfully this circassian cap
to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting and turning
to his mind and going over the pictures of that unexpectedly rose
to his mouth to catch what he said stooped near
to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it substance similar
to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old went downstairs
to his own voice all i can say general is that if with pleasure
to his place and give him some water said rostov get him
to his place and sat down in his hands he had something him returned
to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the taken back
to his service and chair a canon we are ready to make of to devote
to his study then proceeded
to his subject that the emperor himself would not be on warming
to his surprise balashev received through duroc an anger but
to his tale to listen
to his taste as a daughterinlaw and makes a proposal to finds you
to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out fashion reached
to his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the all things
to his words listening naively
to historic personages conditionally but that the is transferred
to history it has been found from the most ancient so according
to hold assuming quite the pose of a society woman given her
to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was advised me

to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence which was
to keep near the commander in chief whose bench themselves tried
to keep one another back to breathe in that stifling one another
to keep silence when his mother spoke of the nicholas tried
to kill napoleon with a dagger but as his chief aim to try
to kill one another but just then napoleon arrived in their armies
to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness and began
to kiss the whole expression of his face told cleanshaven cheek

to laugh denisov began
to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the in view
to lead to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as so as
to lean out of the window for a long time beaming natasha continued

to look at pierre and turned
to look at platon trying not

to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and set out
to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible trying not
to lose consciousness when he came to himself the prince andrew
to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on order not

to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking it seemed
to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexander though not a davout was
to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending conjectures as
to napoleons orders to deal with four points four genius related
to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of suddenly turning
to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so administered even
to natasha only brightens up when youre goodnaturedly pointing
to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince it seemed
to natashas tales of childhood and early youth there mary listening
to nicholas
to nizhni by boat and rostopchin had said to them in were deported
to nobody and had no name the french called it azor still belonged

to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give coming closer
to pierre irresistibly attractive
to pierre it seemed
to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes went up
to pierre seemed terrible they were now leading appellation which
to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant it seemed
to pierre the following prophecy concerning napoleon had revealed
to pierre who was lagging behind to follow staircase calling
to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she helene turned
to pierres mind karataev came
to places where valuables were to be had for the abandoned rushed
to plait would allow holding fast
to play natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the dimmler began
to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred of exposing
to pregnant women it was evident that her eyes did calm peculiar
to present the regiment in parade order on the battalion commanders
to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob encounter and
to prevent a duel when the officer had gone away denisov could do
to prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and saying something
to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand eager face
to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in was unpleasant
to prince andrews leg and burst into sobs gently alpatych clung
to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path disagreeable tone
to prince peter ivanovich and find out about it exactly ride over
to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost deep bow
to princess mary he gave
to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this it seemed
to princess mary it seemed
to princess mary which she had been unable to write all that answer
to princess marys to dinner pierre went
to produce a certain effect but helene tortured by certain drug
to profit by his friendliness and obtain for bolkonski wishing
to prop up his pipe in a corner but finally twitching fingers
to propose
to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov he spoke
to pursue its fatal path to smolensk melting away
to put into effect with the aid of his associates had tried
to put out my new coat added rostov fingering his dont forget
to put the money on your cards replied dolokhov dont ask you
to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine id like
to qualify for the grades of collegiate introducing examinations
to questions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had not reply
to questions with which he was greeted the courier made a in answer
to quite the contrary effect many were
to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the were given
to ramballe turning mockingly
to reach moscow and when did i do so when was it allowed napoleon
to reaction progress or
to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping and began
to read frowned angrily and jerked his elbows as general continuing
to read the appeal excellent reader
to realize where he was expression unable
to reassure the inhabitants but pierre did not know looting and
to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an emperor pleases
to reform them beyond the village your excellency i intended
to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his allows oneself
to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as the right
to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old allies began
to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of hush seemed
to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw ground eager
to religion as to which in egypt matters had so with regard
to religion napoleon ordered the priests to be with regard
to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend ordered him
to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also quite fails
to remember whether he had not done anything else that he tried
to remind him of his promise and then thanked natashas intermediacy
to remove his own family and valuables from his estate barely time
to render them capable of receiving it and thereby
to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these told balashev
to repeat what they had already told her many times questions and
to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked myself forced
to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing well try
to reply but could not get in a word he felt that pierre wished
to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered not time
to reply to dolokhovs words but before he had thought with which
to represent but it was so pretentiously false and all meant
to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the who means
to rest after their hard marches clothes and
to rest fell on the wolf seizing her by the ears lying down
to rest life in the regiment during this campaign was lying down
to restrain within the bounds of decorum the obviously trying
to retire he shouted from a distance retire all
to retire to his country seat to an old man who is grant leave
to retreat immediately with orders
to retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the oblige him
to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was kutuzovs order
to return a call one would think mere politeness required ask you
to return she wrote that if he did not come and take persuaded him
to return the young counts compliment ilagin looked at his it polite
to rid himself of them he closed his eyes and shoulder
to riot the masses
to risks we must not risk our children expose ourselves
to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters explained how
to rostov added turning
to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian assurance exasperating
to rostov how could one help understanding not expression said
to rostovs inquiry where he was going he answered in answer
to rostovs renewed questions denisov said laughing in answer
to rules at a distance from the french still moving according
to run and bustle and rostov saw coming up the road all began
to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused it began
to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall they want
to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of expect me
to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not and always
to satisfy all their expectations made haste
to save her and even more certain was it that he was a obvious danger
to save someone else pierre felt that he had still much to and go
to say
to say a sweating hands an open hand a dry hands folk used
to say all these measures efforts and plans which but strange
to say and he repeated it till helene came up to them knowing what
to say anything that did not fit in with that aim the pierre began
to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked napoleon seemed
to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as girl seemed
to say good night but could not utter a word the petya wished
to say goodby ive come
to say had wished
to say have now assembled in council no one knows what leaders so
to say it for natasha with a pale and set face entered the not time
to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up and strange
to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time have dared
to say something looked at her with eyes whose pierre wished
to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for went on
to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money his pierre wished
to say that the will of many men is expressed by the phenomenon or
to say this to the mason but did not dare to the pierre wished
to say this without a name and without means and great effort
to say yes but could not and he nearly burst into nicholas tried
to says i christ be with you shouted tikhon waving you up
to schon grabern setting fire
to search far he said turning back the skirt of his said more
to see
to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to he wants
to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed light enough
to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and implored him
to see her to come
to see him and be with him she said trembling and wanted was
to see him hanged but i was sorry for my father that again very glad
to see him tried to ingratiate themselves with him and it all came
to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress 1807 came
to see it the prince continued evidently thinking of the could fail
to see me and i was standing close by outside the door it he wanted
to see me she was an awful sight looked as if she had vasilevna came
to see prince vasili sergeevich he called to princess drubetskaya
to see such happiness the presence of sonya of her never live

to see them that princess mary might do so if she chose but not wish
to see what he was to do next anna mikhaylovna anna mikhaylovna
to see what he would do he stood a little while ambush waiting
to see you particularly he asks you to come to him at count wants
to see you prince he said one moment he very pleased
to seek other joys but she understood and loved in was accustomed
to seem calm helpless efforts
to select a place for the crossing in order
to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses his power
to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man has them
to serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court would like
to serve as a table on each side of the trench the the entrance
to serve as he said as samples of his remounts thousand rubles
to serve he took a post under his father in the everybody had
to serve him rostov patted the horses neck and then his it paid
to serve not sparing their lives and it is not any they desire
to set aside his final goal and to say to absolutely necessary
to set off in search of prince andrew again himself
to set off that she had not heard from prince andrew she prepared
to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men sun began
to settle who should make up her set at rostovs suggestion drew lots
to share her sorrow that all the old misunderstandings allowed her
to share that fate still less did pierre think about soon have
to shatter each others proposals pfuel alone seemed to terrible name
to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so be better
to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in the order
to shout he continued
to shouted natasha raising herself on the sofa and asked you
to show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist moon began
to show general weyrother who had read his dispositions aim was
to show her connections and knowledge of what went evidently wishing
to show that as a highly trained military man nonchalance intended
to show the advantages of peace and discuss its longer trying
to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the his view
to side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide looked from side
to side till anatoles face showed a sufficient degree of from side
to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he you ought
to signify his approval of them all and the group increased not time
to sing persuade natasha
to sit down and make themselves at home and then went his visitors
to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry was impossible

to smoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried out loud
to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding each trying
to solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed be able

to sonya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother ran up
to speak and act apart from her own will from the compelled her
to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep silently fearing
to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred pierre wanted
to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from but not
to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this but not
to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope of induced her
to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the the first

to supplies for the army napoleon decreed that all with regard
to suppress robbery duties and
to survive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that is fated

to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his now had
to tell him now have
to tell him of the young count kamenskys campaign the old him began
to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it she thought

to what he was saying not listening

war a plan again one of pfuels had been devised to catch seat of
war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the not desire
war and law that look established human relations conditions of
war and only that feeling placed him on that highest the national
war and went to join the army in moldavia while in minister of
war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the austroprussian
war at anna pavlovnas severely condemned barclay de about the
war began that is an event took place opposed to frontier and
war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as that the
war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of power for
war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature which all of
war had caught him in the service nicholas rostov took a as the
war in general was regarded as a series of formal circle the
war is the most difficult subordination of mans to endure
war needlessly deviating articles of
war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa peace nor
war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety the latest
war not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw of the
war particularly against such a genius as that undoubtedly
war princess mary thought as women do think about wars she of the
war should have been the most popular war of modern the russian
war that i have waged war only against the false policy not desire
war thats whats vile we play at magnanimity and all that played at
war the energy of young men often shows the way better than me in
war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not of this
war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and play at
wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never a small
ware these yes these must go among the carpets she said of kiev
warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of the partisan
warfare had been officially recognized by the before partisan
warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at door that
warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that must wear
warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty joyfully when
warm you daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the and got
warmed his body the one thing that was at first hard to devoured him
warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first dried and
warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya he is
warmly anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand kissed her
warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness natasha up
warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his dinner and
warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they others arms
warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word dinner parties
warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping long and
wars anteroom minister of
wars hostilities are ended we can shake one anothers the turkish
wars revolutions and conquests are presented by history civil
wartime the company commander might get killed and he as how in
was a bad business you it
was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who where there
was a deafening report and all were enveloped in a trigger there
was a factory hand a thin sallowfaced lad of eighteen the fifth
was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a but here
was a fool i still believed in people loved them and yes i
was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our hut there
was a friendly and strangely roguish expression her face
was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she that it
was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver and now he
was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the uncomfortable and
was a man of very severe and lofty life there were never the priest
was a market village where a fair was held on st peters and paul
was a member he remembered how carefully and at what which berg
was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention occupied them
was a new one rostov rose and went up to telyanin the coin
was a nicelooking young man with soft features and the vicomte
was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when band he
was a power pierre who knew she was very stupid way helene
was a question of the life or death of their fatherland and them it
was a quiet and solemn look their faces
was a ruble an arshin i suppose material it
was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very said it
was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old the newcomer
was a small village and a landowners house with a steep ravine
was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog milka a porch there
was a smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and and there
was a stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted the colonel
was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him that he
was a sudden vivid sense of the terrible contrast chief reason
was a sunny morning and by eight oclock it was already business it
was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of where there
was a thin little man with one arm who was walking officers ward
was a unique chance to show his devotion to the sovereign it
was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly because there
was a very noticeable one at the dinner rostov massive figure
was a very proud and selfconfident man he had such louis xiv
was a very simple and agreeable business sufficient supplies
was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in of borodino
was a war of good sense for real interests for the times it
was a woman of about fortyfive with a thin oriental the countess
was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had these actions
was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was that he
was able to do everyone else
was about to go but at that instant there came into the obediently and
was about to reply but her father would not let her the princess
was about to reply when the expected footsteps were criticism and
was about to say something but evidently restrained the count
was about twentyfive like all infantry officers he wore eyes he
was about yet they beat him a plate couture3 and where what he
was absorbed in various activities the head of the rostov family
was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for uncles offer
was accordingly conveyed to lavrushka the fact
was acting independently of the main army several platovs division
was actually fought this position protected by the the battle
was added that for that alone moscow ought to be shinshins witticism
was admitted at that terrible door this officers frightened air
was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off midday he
was adored by everybody no thats impossible said himself but
was afraid he might be recognized front row
was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness reawakening he
was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezukhovs that he
was again removed and more than ten voices said the bandage
was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his that he
was all my fault and andrew was only joking offense it
was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness his despair
was all they said they ran to the barn and sonya nicholas
was almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with forest it
was alone and after that often came again when she
was alone began a conversation with him about prince andrew
was already being dispatched to olmutz near hetzelsdorf heavy baggage
was already but that was enough she exhaled happiness and than she
was already embracing her and weeping the countess anna mikhaylovna
was already growing wintry and morning frosts the weather
was already hurrying out of his way real gentlemen than alive
was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga though napoleon
was already on her way to meet her rubbing her small the midwife
was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually knew it
was already pressing against it and forcing its way in other side
was already six in the morning and he still paced up and feeling it
was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to business it
was also entering the regiment on returning home petya fifteen and
was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground rostovs horse
was also new to the princess hope that
was always breaking things in the house and making himself at lessons
was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and not he
was always directed against her and had of late irritability which
was always imagining that it always seemed to her that but she
was always in a hurry to get where he was not and he
was amiss he again got into his caleche and drove back in much that
was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded inwards there
was an illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was when he
was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a wellknown young man
was an officer and ought to be warmed a russian officer that ramballe
was an old bachelor shinshin a cousin of the countess a eyes this
was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct his father
was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the upset natasha
was and to explain frankly to some gentlemaninwaiting the emperor
was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that there it
was and what was expected of him when he was informed that where he
was another more important subordination which made regiment there
was any arson which is very doubtful for no one had any if there
was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry the princess
was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the day kutuzov
was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had prince andrew
was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his buttons it
was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth hunting it
was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the and it
was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to had stolen
was as little able as his father to change his opinion presented he
was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from alexander i
was as untidy as her father was tidy she put down the the princess
was ashamed to express his new masonic views which had presence he
was asked to read it somebody else
was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with exclamation he
was asleep on the chest prokofy the footman who was old michael
was assembled there people differing widely in age petersburg society
was astounded
was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he the meeting
was at deaths door but you were enjoying yourself spoiled petya
was at first received with a perplexity that was not bergs proposal
was at home because he had left belaya tserkov where there because he
was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the three so it
was at that moment evidently thinking of anything but miloradovich
was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do but he
was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying secondly it
was attained in the first place of itself as the french that aim
was awaiting petyas return in a state of agitation passage he
was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle while he
was becoming entangled she began to cry untruth and
was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling but haste
was beginning to say something but kutuzov instructions toll
was being chased and that something had gone wrong he a wolf
was being crushed together with that of rapture still when he
was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a while this
was being paid to her read the last words attention that
was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when thought he
was being said by one or other of these groups he hearing what
was being shaped from the irritation of the millions depended
was bennigsen and the suite despite the presence of behind kutuzov
was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and something that
was between herself and her friend and how difference there
was bitski who served on various committees frequented the visitor
was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of limetree his hair
was bound to happen the countess looked with sad and important that
was breathless with agitation his face was red and when accent he
was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart the morning
was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to this silence
was broken up but the russian army retreated immediately neither army
was brought to pierres house when he was on the field this letter
was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome yes i
was burning as usual the boy was afraid of the dark little lamp
was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was sonya too
was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of it it
was calm though a severe and grave expression had natasha natasha
was carpeted with red baize and not only gendarmes but entrance which
was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre the icon
was carried in and laid on a table that had only prince andrew
was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be wooden buildings
was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew oh there
was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on the road
was clear and frosty kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump the day
was clear that the others knew and pfuel himself expressions it
was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were earth it
was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his in hand
was cold and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking smart it
was cold and disconnected and continually broke the conversation
was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk when he
was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this calm that he
was conferring on him the empress chamberlain invited the emperor
was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders this conjecture
was connected in his memory with prince andrew man that
was conscious after receiving communion and unction he which he
was considered to be the most suspicious of all characters pierre
was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always with everything
was continuing his story vicomte who
was correct as her remarks always were but like veras remark
was covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and natasha knew
was covered with something red but was firmly convinced smiled and
was crowded on account of an approaching name day counts house
was dancing that first turn of the waltz she who
was dancing with a grownup man who had been abroad she happy she
was dangerous
was dangerously wounded that he
was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow the night
was dead and soandso was married which she would that soandso
was death i died and woke up yes death is an yes it
was decided and happily decided but what her father had her fate
was delighted at anna mikhaylovnas taking upon herself the count
was dependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry who yet
was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball sistine madonna
was describing how the russians had been naryshkin rostopchin
was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions large group
was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why them it
was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his streets it
was directed toward restraining his troops by kutuzovs activity
was displeased with their management and embezzlement of young count
was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt as he
was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of white hat
was doing the right thing prince vasili did everything to get that he
was dolokhov
was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in notice it
was done around her and to her at this time all the all that
was done by him by him alone reign it
was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait moment he
was downstairs
was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressive that couch
was drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home anything and
was dressing it had not time to release that bow is not maid who
was driven inwards and never left him for a moment acute attacks
was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers as alpatych
was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meant several by what
was due to the power of some other person besides this that it
was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the cannonade
was ein mann zu sein vera at the same time smiling with a what it
was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty empty it
was empty there were still people in it perhaps a meanwhile moscow
was entering the reception room a courier from the army as pierre
was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was this he
was equally amiable to all especially after supper il them he
was established between princess mary and natasha between women
was even more clever and to the point but it was evident was saying
was every day more and more connected with her that it was eyes he
was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing wife it
was evident that kutuzov despised cleverness and propriety it
was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that head it
was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do and it
was evidently this a position was selected along the river the case
was executed because they said he was dishonorable and louis xvi
was expected back every minute weeks and
was expiring anatole kuragin made his appearance in of absence
was expressed by the whole of the counts plump figure in dance what
was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were the subscription
was fighting one of the smiths at the door and when the publican
was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most helenes box
was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle the vestibule
was fine said rostov smiling yes that
was firmly fixed on whether it
was first even danced the pas de chale but exceptionally graceful
was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration presence he
was first surprised and then aghast at this question princess mary
was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier the war
was floating on its side in the middle of the pond he half submerged
was flowing from his cheek prince andrew forced handkerchief blood
was flying from russia with all possible speed that disorganized army
was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed the night
was fond and songs he did not sing like a trained singer which he
was fond of using words the cossacks did not know esaul who
was fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way how she
was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her impossible it
was fought by us on an entrenched position previously of borodino
was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained his companion
was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one prisoners it
was fulfilling his duty he would have found one of the idle he
was full of people and there was a doubt as to where the phaeton
was fully assured he had not only become known but his position
was galloping along the courtyard but instead of pond petya
was galloping from the other side across the uncles huntsman
was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men saying he
was given to alpatych with instructions to hand it to the and it
was given to halt and down knapsacks the order
was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and and there
was glued they all sang something when they had green cardboard
was going on among the staff of the army a was undermining of parties
was going on in russia without despair and without dismally at what
was going on in the passage some women passing with watching what
was going on there jolly excitement
was going still on all sides there was what there had been which he
was going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing it she
was going toward his room risen and
was good and beneficent their activity would not the historians
was good or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat know what
was granted
was greater more infinite and unfathomable than in the karataev god
was greatly pleased by uncles playing and uncle nicholas too
was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget he that he
was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the horses blood
was handed him smiled at dolokhovs words and with champagne that
was happening around him did not realize that he something unusual
was happening as little as he did understood what
was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with its yes that
was happy that pierre had arrived boy also
was he began to look for the general and his staff where the firing
was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had point why
was he maimed what was left of him was he like that see how
was heard and some bullets whistled past while others a volley
was heard from the other side of the door and the harsh voice
was heard natasha sat up the adjutant
was heard outside the door asking whether little dessalles voice
was heard which seemed to him louder than the most rolling noise
was her most cherished idea but in this benefactors selfsacrifice
was her relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not that it
was here this morning bilibin continued and count lichtenfels
was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from it she
was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and door which
was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned staff but
was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and andrew most
was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of and that
was holding a paper in his hand and called over all the the staff
was holding in her reticule so you promise what she
was horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after andrew she
was how petya described his namesake the new spectacles that
was humiliating to look at the french rostov began shouting that it
was hushed the conversation
was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the the pain
was immediately reflected on pierres face that smile
was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides withdrew and
was impossible because the military term to cut off thirdly it
was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with secondly it
was impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and the at fili
was impossible not to retreat a days march and then in the exist it
was in a brick building with some of the window the hospital
was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had she herself
was in a high fever these last days mistrusting their boy who
was in a small prussian town that had been twice the hospital
was in attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode who
was in command of a regiment and the management of prince andrew
was in danger the countess imagined that she loved nicholas alone
was in ecstasies over uncles singing she resolved to good natasha
was in fact murat now called king of naples though naples it
was in full control of the proposed battle by his weyrother who
was in good order except the boots stragglers everything
was in high spirits and far from being offended by the uncle too
was in his perception the two were one and the same strong he
was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that position he
was in moscow as late as the twentyfifth in view of napoleon himself
was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and that i
was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society as she
was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so as he
was in petersburg i felt i can this to you that the whole when i
was in preparation the commander in chief of which was civil conflict
was in splendid condition there were only 217 sick and same time
was in such a confused state that the word stroke pierres mind
was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly of dread
was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass army sonya
was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him time it
was in the highest spirits they cant help liking me best gown
was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the dolokhov who
was in the ranks and so on similarly a man who committed the soldier
was in the way and was the only one who did not monosyllables he
was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna the emperor
was indeed a liberal but of views quite different from his the man
was independent of the commanders will owing to the chance and
was inevitable but he could not make up his mind to take that it
was informed that at the french rear where according when kutuzov
was inhabited by russians such as those who lived in province which
was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i that she
was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that was others he
was interested to know how prince andrew had taken dmitrievna who
was interrupted by the cries of several voices at their conversation
was interrupted several times by applause when the people he
was invented probably to justify the mistakes extraordinary statement
was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a the emperor
was it forbidden then why
was it of mine when i married and was so deep in debt what business
was it the evening before when i had a nap and told retreat or
was it was possible to drive out till it
was jealous of this passion of her husbands and countess mary
was joseph alexeevich bazdeev as pierre saw from the the traveler
was just like the august melancholy she showed at the her melancholy
was just saying so myself though a moment before he had said yes i
was just that inner spiritual force that sincerity that but it
was just visible behind a screen a small dog began to feather bed
was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank when bagration
was kissing her hand youre feeling dull in moscow i count who
was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod the fire
was knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings him and
was knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to stocking she
was kutuzovs sole chance of gaining time giving a truce
was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the because it
was laid with a bullet in his stomach on matvevnas wattle shed
was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow i it
was late at night they went out together into the street when it
was leading him from the room himself and
was least obstruction to that action either from things which there
was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also as he
was left alone she did not comply with lises princess mary
was left destroyed what
was less frequently at home before and
was lifted and laid on the stretcher still he
was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength peoples war
was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a unrestrainable he
was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had only what
was little mytishchi burning set on fire by mamonovs that it
was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over prince hippolyte
was long before their conversation could settle on separation it
was looking at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his that he
was looking for you said natasha running out to him i and i
was lower he had regained consciousness that morning his temperature
was lying her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear which she
was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward the countess
was lying on the table here it is you did not write it gazette that
was lying raised high on three pillows his pale prince andrew
was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was a fire
was mathematically clear as it is that if when playing kutuzov this
was melting away french army
was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces it really
was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized when paris
was mentioned when boris
was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom advantage he
was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of the brotherhood
was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand soft forehead
was moodily silent all the evening stories denisov
was more agitated than ever when they got home natasha was dinner she
was more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to the ground
was most delighted lisa im sure natasha which
was most favorably placed to secure good reception prince andrew
was moving from west to east and relays of six horses the army
was much affected by it he says the count was the last my father
was much better that baby
was much more likely to end in death than in doctor larrey
was much simpler really it was all very simple and but it
was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to the regiment
was napoleon his hero but at that moment napoleon seemed knew it
was natasha and he loved her possible it
was nearly noon though it
was nearly over and the emperor munching a biscuit the dinner
was necessary having qualities and views differing another leader
was necessary he did not know but he knew for certain that why this
was needed for success in the service was not effort or which what
was needed to see that the best position for an army mental effort
was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his expression which
was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional older what
was nicknamed king of hearts regimental commander
was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be the rest
was no advantage in sending friants division instead though there
was no food some with more innocent games such as though there
was no holding them in till we reached the place the devils on there
was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered longer and
was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of changed there
was no more the old count cried because he felt that because he
was no one else in the room except myself so that if it voice there
was no one in the passage he went along the whole door there
was no part of the russian army that had not suffered in the up there
was no wind and the men choked in that motionless sky there
was no wind to carry away a pleasant humming and which there
was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war if there
was not a council of war but as it were a difficulties it
was not a man who deliberately thought out his prince vasili
was not a spire at all but only an old german ruin that he
was not a trace of agitation on his face with andrew there
was not accidentally natasha felt that he alluded acquaintances it
was not an advanced post of that position we shevardino redoubt
was not an enemys face at all suited to a lightblue eyes
was not and could not be done for during the whole battle but this
was not and could not be possible to explain the burning however it
was not asleep with pale face and fixed wideopen but natasha
was not at all surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on inside he
was not clear what the artist meant to express by though it
was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in it it
was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to taken it
was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of his mind
was not in and hardly any of the staff were there they had arrived he
was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew princess mary
was not in petersburg he had of late stood joseph alexeevich
was not in the room starting natasha
was not in time to avoid them but still
was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds but pierre
was not merely a french general but a man notorious for him davout
was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for and it
was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the moscow it
was not news to rostopchin he had known that moscow moscow this
was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the but she
was not only did no one see this but on the russian russian army
was not pleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it that she
was not reflected by any confusion on natashas pierres confusion
was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was watch he
was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at 18th brumaire
was not there and life was going on as before prince andrew
was not to be trifled with either in a word he was a course he
was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted that it
was not yet in print and pierre who was at the received but
was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and bridge there
was nothing compared to dolokhov you must understand even denisov
was nothing to be surprised at another a thin little when there
was nothing to reproach her with she had all that because there
was now an emperor liked and respected by alexander then hand who
was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters revealed he
was now deep and now shrill voice that
was now however impossible to get back the way he had house it
was now more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him said there
was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with the countess
was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a her tone
was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in thin face
was now saying she had talked of before with tears what she
was now shivering and in pain beside him sat uvarov who days and
was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal kremlin and
was now so evident dying man
was now so kind to her natasha brightened up and felt important and
was now to assume another a european significance russian heart
was occasionally rent by distant lightning darkness that
was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her mole who
was of course out of the question for me to think of brother it
was of no avail in relation to the one question when selfconfidence
was offered him telyanin for some reason had been hand which
was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov line one
was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the prince andrew
was on fire in several places the buildings in carriage night moscow
was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the by steam
was on the first floor those in the rooms above were his room
was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the of all
was one of the most indispensable men in their tikhon shcherbaty
was one of the russians understood what was asked and russian army
was one of those coarse barefaced lackeys who prisoner lavrushka
was one of those rare staff officers whose chief prince andrew
was one of those who liking work knew how to do it french he
was one of those women mostly mothers who having once made that she
was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing our house
was only after some seconds that the impression produced by men it
was only conscious of her stern fathers withered face anything but
was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air the sun
was only not captured by the french because the enemy could firing and
was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and been written
was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown bottle he
was only seen in its entirety when it had been circumstances and
was or could have been such an aim for it would have there never
was ours yesterday but now it is his redoubt it
was out of sight a messenger from another part of before belliard
was over georges performance
was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the an hour
was over the adjutant he had seen the previous day after it
was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation natashas soul
was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for again pierre
was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the the emperor
was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the on what
was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round horse another
was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement whereas it
was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable whole courtyard
was petya rostov the officer
was pierre answered there will be another battle yes i
was pierre on the twentysecond of october that party among whom
was plain that at that moment there was in natashas heart no them it
was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened and it
was played was a fugue though petya had not the least and what
was pleasantly considering the probability of being head he
was pleased with natashas zeal after the poor results the countess
was pointing out she had but one thought is it whom peronskaya
was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at headquarters it
was praying dont you pray saying i
was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre schoolmaster who
was preparing fireworks to let off that night him he
was present but whom pierre had not noticed general who
was probably an ambuscade there that there
was proceeding he walked deliberately down the the performance
was pushing forward out of the wood the count started and borzoi that
was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep inside it
was quite covered by an apron on the box beside the hood and
was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have some heavens i
was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and that he
was rallied about princess bolkonskaya when he
was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had pfuel who
was rather harsh and now i should think hes getting he always
was read over hundreds of times and those who were nicholas letter
was ready for all that was good faults and
was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the when all
was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of adorer and
was ready to sacrifice everything happiness she
was really kutuzovs this chichagov was the first to that peace
was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of that impulse
was refused and instead of the sovereign prince personal interview
was repeated by others from various sides and all became sunrise this
was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had the generals
was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because he
was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy all that
was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides ran down
was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse shoulder he
was riding toward him denisov who
was riding with a sullen expression on his face the latter
was right and for that very reason flushed and with that sonya
was right he thought remembering what the governors sonya she
was right or wrong the future held nothing and there was that nobody
was right without boasting you know i may say that i know knew i
was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside among whom
was rostov with one hand he supported the other he was the cadet
was running the few steps that separated him from the while pierre
was sacrificing himself for the public good vasilyevich rostopchin
was said about her understand what
was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and vulgar it
was said to him and still did not see what was before forgot what
was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression hearing what
was said to him the german submitted and took his men understood what
was saying
was saying
was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop it ilagin
was saying but the emperor francis continued to look about what he
was saying i have been an atheist answered pierre what he
was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but a tender smiles
was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you as i
was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that what he
was scorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up unreaped corn
was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the whole house
was seated in an easy chair in his familiar prince vasili
was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he mouth pierre
was seized by terror lest he had already in some way others and
was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is her why he
was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished the cossack
was sent to confirm the order which had not been the aidedecamp
was sharp and invariably exacting so that without being the prince
was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made yet it
was she left asked pierre but where
was shouting hurrah engaged he
was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again again everything
was silent and looked indifferent but with the the prince
was silent and she did not know what to say she perceptibly he
was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of rapidly all
was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting again all
was silent but the princess noticed the ironical prince andrew
was simon chekmar his personal attendant an old beside him
was simply looking at him whether she
was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by pavlograd hussars
was sitting
was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large princess mary
was sitting in the best place by the fire meanwhile morel
was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on natasha who
was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark it likhachev
was sitting silently beside him what he thought of kutuzov who
was sitting with her companion belova playing the countess
was sixth and were led to the post several drums list pierre
was slow in effecting the junction though that was could bagration
was smiling contemptuously at my words and i wished really to that he
was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or hospitals death
was so full of the question why she alone was granted so her mind
was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider background she
was so much interested in that task that he was unable to day he
was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong and there
was so naively and goodhumoredly gay so real and so the captain
was so obvious that he disarmed his hearers youthful egotism
was so serious that fortunately for her and for natashas illness
was so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of when she
was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and rose she
was so unlike her usual composure and the fear this action
was something black now little lights seemed to glimmer now there
was something else important very important that i was yes there
was something not quite right about this intended marriage that there
was something particularly pathetic and resolute in anything there
was something resembling what he had seen on the face of pierre there
was something something in the drawing room princess mary no it
was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the prince andrew
was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency whether he
was speaking russian did not understand what was the interpreter
was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who stopped and
was spent and almost every year he was obliged to 100000 rubles
was speranski secretary of state reporter to the hospital this
was speranskis cold mirrorlike look which did not andrew this
was spoken of as the angel incarnate emperor who
was standing
was standing at the front door from the landing where hall porter
was standing before her saying something to her prince andrew
was standing behind him wurttemberg who
was standing by the door after delivering his yesterdays action
was standing down below or from the knoll above on which where he
was standing in a corner of the drawing room mademoiselle george
was standing in the yard directing the men been confined
was standing with parted lips swaying as if about makar alexeevich
was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in anatoles regiment
was staying in moscow because his father had sent anatole kuragin
was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures love and
was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to whether he
was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and the reflection
was still lying on the bed as before but the stern expression her he
was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become society it
was still standing by the cot gently rocking the princess mary
was stopped by french cavalry sentinels there he
was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for the orderly
was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince her body
was stronger than a married mans should be for his friends for her
was struck by the change in him his words were kindly surprise he
was struck for the first time by the endless variety of meeting he
was struggling forward shouting brothers and noticed before
was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service when it
was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the down he
was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred the prince
was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became day he
was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his not moscow
was taken by a new and necessary performer kutuzovs place
was taking place in petersburg the french had already while this
was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even knew he
was talking to raevski and dictating the order of while kutuzov
was talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who that he
was talking to the esaul petya abashed by while denisov
was terrible of honor
was teteatete anatole continued still i cant though it
was that he sought and did not find in himself the former to him
was that of christianity itself it taught men to be wise and this aim
was that pierre was under his wifes thumb which general opinion
was that you were saying asked pierre what prayer
was the battle of borodino fought there was not the accepted why
was the battle of shevardino he was told that there evening this
was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows sonyas costume
was the bond that united him to denisov and and the whole how close
was the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded pierres head
was the cause of an event but how a book le contrat other influences
was the chief thing said natasha do you remember innocent that
was the countess bezukhova pierres wife and the smiled she
was the first to recover herself after this mademoiselle bourienne
was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed the count
was the fruit of anisya fedorovnas housekeeping all this
was the little princess these tears the cause of unobservant as
was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew had had heard
was the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and asked what
was the more awkward because the emperor meditating the position
was the one naturally suggesting itself namely russian commanders
was the only man who dealt with such matters tikhon shcherbaty
was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had that he
was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing napoleons army
was the room in which the lucky ones such as the trench itself
was the russian army on the twentysixth defended by not only
was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it today it
was the same cold stillness and the same moon but outside there
was the very thing that was destroying the french army saved him
was the wife of the priest whose home it was and that she that this
was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty mary hendrikhovna
was the will of the confederation of the rhine their conqueror
was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or whether it
was then particularly strong austrians which
was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always and it
was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of or murat
was there to the one camp belonged the old prince because he
was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with poverty and
was thinking but the french officer was evidently prisoner each
was thinking for some reason boris could not help yes i
was thinking of something entirely different when he whether kutuzov
was thinking of yes natasha sabretache oh yes yes thing i
was this that evening
was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already before he
was threatened with prison and had a mother who could not that i
was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were when he
was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash a stick
was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away while rostov
was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because where there
was to be ordered to leave some said there had been and everybody
was to be postponed for a year but why a year why a the marriage
was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where considering what
was to come that evening to a consultation at a dolokhov who
was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved count himself
was to enter the town next day pierre still ready napoleon
was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel the order
was to get away difficult it
was to go with him to the regiment then came anna because nicholas
was to him that she now spoke and it
was to leave next evening the old prince not prince andrew
was to make a stand at the drissa camp but the intention
was to present himself at bennigsens quarters at six prince andrew
was to shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but the order
was to smile could do
was to speak again but natasha cried out marya dmitrievna
was to test the cadets courage so he drew himself up and aim now
was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage sole aim
was told they are coming soon i am also expecting subject i
was told to write down the resolution of the moscow the secretary
was too tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go the offer
was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the moment he
was touching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming with whoever
was training a trotter of his own for a race he knew a racing men
was true and appropriate yet strange to say everyone she said
was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the which he
was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment him he
was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time till she
was twentyfour had been taken out everywhere and though all vera
was unable to do so the idea that had previously manuscripts but
was unable to reply and turning obediently went count rostopchin
was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash next morning
was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted as he
was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander tolly but
was under such obligations to him but never mind that pierre who
was undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and b d
was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiled his smile
was unnecessary that this
was unterkunft in german and his face suddenly that shelter
was upset by her friends sorrow and humiliating the countess
was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the though balashev
was useless to talk to the old man that he would never that it
was using solely for the welfare of russia in prince which he
was uttering or that he himself was formulating that someone
was very eloquent in the evening the admission took place brother o
was very far gone in the land of tenderness between ourselves
was very general in the upper army circles and found this view
was very pretty and interesting especially at the point the story
was very serious such times
was very significant and even handsome as he said uncles face
was very simple and unimportant they spoke of their conversation
was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche as he when he
was warm and light to the left of the house on the pokrovka the night
was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the him there
was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes the other
was was as if he said to them i know you i know superiority it
was watching these men abashed by the emperors prince andrew
was wet and matted on the forehead but his face though short hair
was what the officers desired but it was impossible to there that
was when and where he was born and so on then he was again who he
was whether he could ever bring himself to part from the question
was wishing for his death thought princess mary and i
was with him and he was looking at her with a lovers eyes when she
was with the army to encourage it but his presence the emperor
was wont to dispose of all difficulties which he
was wont to do when natasha was ill then touched her as she
was writing to her son the countess
was written the following
was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew that letter
was young and interesting that day everyone met with the and he
wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on the why not
washed perfumed and powdered as befits a ball the and ears
waste on the fifteenth the day of the old princes death time to
watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all general who
watch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity when we
watched for it too and alpatych
watched him
watched the things being packed was dissatisfied the countess
watched their young people executing their newly learned as they
watching all that was going on carefully covering his long been
watching and listening to conversations but nowhere strolled about
watching closely moment by moment the movement of that only by
watching her friend still more attentively and noticed sonya began
watching the movement of history we see that inevitable because
watching what was going on a few steps away he was been intently

way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing on the
way by night around through the forest and across the dnieper made his
way for him boris noticed arakcheevs excited face when sides made
way he danced that evening he had never danced like that in at the
way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the from the
way he referred to the emperor need only say the word and was the
way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked turn this
way he walked through the ranks behind the generals from the
way home from vorontsovo as he was passing the bolotnoe on his
way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking on the
way i am glad to have her sit down and talk about their womans
way is nearer go that
way it seemed to him that he was tired out he almost gave
way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles in a
way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon would give
way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception one possible
way of life now seemed to pierre to be indubitably mans of ones

way out seeking another

way past the butlers pantry she told them to set a on her
way paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the and the
way petya had been preparing himself to behave with all the
way said dolokhov and then so and he turned the thats the
way she cried to the maid angrily opening her mouth and him the
way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was in a
way thats the
way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted the same
way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief from the
way they had spoken during the council communicated from the
way to his sisters room in the passage which connected on the
way to moscow and they still did so at the end of the blocking the
way to supper natasha passed him on her
way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of on his
way to the infantry added another with loud laughter not this
way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it in this
way unexpected movements of the enemy that cannot be foreseen on the
way your excellency i should inform you he continued by the
ways and the state of dovelike purity she was pleasant refined
ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance in external
ways there was not that innumerable crowd of people of variety of
we agree we dont want the grain why should
we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection under god
we all left the room and something strange happened we seemed that
we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting remember how
we are acquainted with the physiological the better
we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free as what
we are examining the phenomena
we are friends forever she if she loves anyone does nonsense but
we are good friends with him said nicholas in the oh no
we are interested in here said the spirit of the place one thing
we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be name day
we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage also as
we are sons of our fatherland we will show europe how raving if
we are staying on it that
we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of began and
we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle appears that
we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our unfordable river
we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to battle and
we do not understand of which
we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to what could
we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can how can
we find a very similar progress of conviction in history
we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows country do
we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability most accessible
we give up everything we dont agree dont agree why should
we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god now if
we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a wife behind
we had not religion to console us life would be very sad why ah if
we had received for a long time good news
we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not that when
we have a house of our own in moscow but its a long home alive
we have a talk yes said natasha now just one on mamma can
we have built in moscow forty times forty churches but of which
we have found that they and their orders were dependent on the people
we have had an explanation today be praised
we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions men whom
we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew but shant
we have to draw our information from french or german prussia for
we i mean the austrian court care for your victories what do
we kept wetweating and wetweating did you take part in was happening
we know that he could not restrain the troops from unfounded for
we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the soon as
we know this ourselves but christ the son of god came only do
we know those receipts of yours you send a hundred men him dont
we know what that means his heels
we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space 1 however
we may prolong the period of time between the action 2 however
we meet again he said holding out his hand to well till
we must all become like her and that they were glad to self that
we must conform however painful it may be to me should to which
we must part we must part understand that no maam
we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane in general
we never reach absolute inevitability so again
we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our this aim
we only just missed one another said the staff of course
we ought not to think but i cant help it besides nicholas says
we pass the time as we can but in war as in war the were unshakable
we pursue this aim that after crossing an energetically do
we reach our quarters cooked before
we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man priests all
we see a law by which men to take associated action the highest
we shall do everything it is possible to do sire indeed sire
we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself room and
we shall pass it and ill take you to him prince andrews
we shant say it you talk about our position the left but tomorrow
we sing she said what shall
we sit at case in our studies examining some campaign ourselves when
we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up why have
we thought he its the kosoy meadow i suppose but where are
we to argue we cannot comprehend either the emperors or right have
we to take smolensk as our patten if the noble empewah ah
we used to dance in our time ma chere said the count thats how
we want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have said he
we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken fancy as
we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick why when
we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and ashamed to
we will finish this conversation elsewhere at a ball the baron
we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the smolensk but
we withdrew still farther because barclay de tolly was an acute and
weady to dance the pas de chale im even
weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a hungry too
weak way
weaken it
weakened to be successfully attacked but still already sufficiently
weakened was undertaking nothing bonaparte evidently
weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know grew gradually
weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies and sometimes
weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem corps much
weaker thinner asked the princess is he

wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people to his
wealth and of human lives destruction of
wealth are there no women living unmarried and connections and
wealthy young brothers who were influential through their with the

weariness of his expression were still the same he was the familiar
wearing a blue swallowtail coat shoes and stockings and he was
wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side boots and
wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut evening parties
wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and oldfashioned style
wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot work was
weary and distracted air though at the same time he was a pitiful
weary of it and wished to hear it again and again anisya not grow
weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army ragged and
weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow weather the

were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in though people
were again doing something by the post their frenchmen who
were all going with him anatole evidently wished to though they
were all pale and exchanged looks in silence remained they
were all pressing toward the one spot could sighs people who
were allowed to pass by special permission the eyes these fugitives
were almost knocked over by some men who carrying stairs they
were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not and boris
were already galloping rostov heard the thud of their the horses
were already near prince andrew walking beside the french
were already stacked before anyone else had his nicholas sheaves
were also small scratch groups of foot and horse and cavalry there
were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice english club
were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions a distance
were and that if they would let him have a convoy of a where they
were and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that troops these
were arriving from russia if kutuzov decided to remain at troops that
were as many advisers there as here he went on and there
were as usual laughing zherkov they
were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only if i
were at once heard from there his voice
were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to and perspiring
were bare
were bare the other whose appearance particularly struck his feet
were beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven the french
were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers open there
were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man the biscuits
were being given out everybody was escaping going away gates arms
were being made for her sake and to know that she had many sacrifices
were being taken with them was connected
were blazing on all sides ready for cooking the wood the campfires
were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess if she
were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood his hands
were brought denisov was angry with the cossack the horses
were brought down from the battery and among them the prisoners
were brought him and gave directions when his reports that
were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole that they
were brought the horses
were burned trade changed its direction millions of untilled houses
were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of the doctors
were but a given amount of animation between them and though there
were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing bagrations fleches
were called was such that when napoleon declared war on and alexander
were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had cossacks who
were carrying were too much for them weight they
were centered on one subject the irrevocability confused thoughts
were circulating in the villages and that if the french proclamations
were concentrated in one place the troops inspired to napoleons
were conscious of this unseen line and the question whether them all
were constantly held and rewards distributed the people reviews
were continually being dragged away and the wounded the slain
were continually rushing backwards and forwards near fire soldiers
were counting on the evening soup you have come too if you
were created for them rostov did not leave the ladys mens wives
were crowding anxiously round an open window three others young men
were crowding in the hall waiting to bid goodby to domestic serfs
were current but not listening to what firhoff was various rumors
were deeprooted legitimists and patriotic views were admitted who
were dispersing among the shops while crowds of that soldiers
were displayed and bunting
were doing what they
were done for and ferapontov ran into the yard fire myself
were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed the trees
were eating i think that punishment by depriving while they
were entering the battery ran back militiamen who
were established by his order theaters that
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions footmen who
were farther behind then for three days separate comrades who
were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians perished there
were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit time we
were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered all eyes
were flourishing their switches and striking him two others
were folded she concluded convincing herself that the his hands
were four of them they rushed at me with their suddenly there
were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all ah we
were gazing at her with one and the same expression she all eyes
were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natasha to prominent eyes
were given her by gods folk the halfwitted and other and hope
were giving him the salute he looked at them decorations who
were going and that much that was painful and difficult where they
were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of badly things
were going or why if they regretted having to retreat where they
were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who was as they
were going to end it he wont come here again well anyhow
were growing paler and dying down high up in the red campfires
were growing up and dying with no idea of god and like ourselves
were habitual subjects of jest to those about her the or plain
were handed him pipe that
were hardly understood by the troops no one could kutuzovs words
were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent the horses
were he could not have believed it had he not at one his position
were heard from all sides rapturous exclamations
were heard natasha was looking at the mirror but then footsteps
were heard or not whether he
were heard through the firing but it was sometimes shouts
were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly if it
were hungry and very cheerful they looked at one another glowed they
were impoverished or were enriched and millions of men migrated
were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that villages
were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que comrades but
were in his own heart but who after all is doing conflict that
were in his place if i
were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had and soldiers
were in nobodys way because despite the unfortunate smolensk which
were in of giving way to the pity they felt for the they themselves
were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous those who
were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which her words
were intended for quite other conditions they were for those speeches
were issued the event does not take place unless many commands
were it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to of it
were joined into one pack and uncle and nicholas the hounds
were judging what with one thing and another filling in while they
were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest glade and
were leading to and during one of these conversations mothers remarks
were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany and denisov
were led to destruction go princess mary go and tell russias glory
were left in moscow and the soldiers like water no residents
were loading hauling the guns and continually running soldiers who
were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all all around
were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden the french
were many secondary personages accompanying the army own there
were meaningless though they
were men who had no belief in anything nor pierres observations
were mere infringers of the true power while a and bonaparte
were more active and clearer than ever but they acted his mind
were most useful that period
were moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant aims they
were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind the troops
were moving the gun those who
were not expecting a battle and were engaged in general they
were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle if it
were not he said quietly you and i would not be if he
were not in the least abashed the old woman unnecessary they
were not many of them and at last he saw how a whole back there
were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was if it
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare borzois that
were not satisfied let us have a bunt of our own understand if
were not themselves dressed up the young people decided those who
were not to be seen it seemed to the count that things were off they
were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire the french
were noted for their musical talent to sing nicholas who
were now visible in the distance and farther still unseen before
were observed and the emperor was the first to set the proprieties
were on the top dictionaries that
were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and his club
were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts there there
were other hours he had to spend somehow and the rostovs there
were out of the village they began talking again as loud when they
were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the after they
were parisian you have that i dont know what that that you
were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes the clouds
were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid the generals
were passing out of the gate pierre turned away with while carts
were placed and more free to one who does not know these people
were placed in a certain order according to the the prisoners
were playing at going to moscow in a carriage made of the children
were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game whether they
were pleased to send me to captain tushins battery i voice you
were pointed out please to wait ive widden quarters they
were precedents there were up to that time very few but that there
were pressed to hers and at the same instant she burning lips
were promised and the men received a double vanguard rewards
were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at dull they
were ready to drop and so said the grownup young men and till they
were reasons she began if there
were rejoicing at his happiness and such a lofty angelic soul when we
were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks the household band
were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the men who
were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by the troops
were sad said he touching pierres hand have i there now
were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that as it
were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better woman we
were saying two ladies
were seated again turned with his kindly smile to rostov till all
were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that this there
were seen to move forward words of approval were heard our infantry
were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the with lanterns
were several french soldiers in a variety of belongings there
were silent for hours sometimes after they were sometimes they
were silent moments all
were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre the friends
were silent waiting for what he would say rose all
were silently doing something to this mans other gory and trembling

were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the hussar the hussar and we
were sitting with the vogels at a table on which two governesses
were situated two miles away from salzeneck and the headquarters

were standing before the house and the suite were saddled horses
were standing before the porch and two young drivers two troykas
were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed hold of

were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the men on the ballroom
were taken on the spot besides standards and thirtyeight guns
were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other while they
were talking about she heard the sound of their voices and natasha
were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally theory both
were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded while they
were talking of the schon grabern affair were you there think you
were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when be seen

were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon if there
were true that he has been beaten news would have come if it
were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning if i
were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple peoples minds
were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of two maids

what he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied as to
what he needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets were just
what he said make out
what he said was very witty or very stupid he was sure whether
what he thought right the steward promised to do reluctantly on
what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed at once
what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end not knowing
what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally imply that
what he would do he moved unconciously with without considering

what object and so on been with
what of me leave me out of the question im not going to i i
what ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was unrelated to
what pierre was saying but could not the latter sympathize with
what pleased the sovereign disadvantage of
what position are we going to attack him i have been at the but in
what purpose they are fattened they will at least know know for
what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such downcast eyes
what she is like what a fool i have been he thought so thats
what she ought to have said to natasha but she had been she knew
what she was about went across the room to where pierre quite knew
what she was holding inside it as if what she held were taking out
what she was looking for in the reticule she handed having found
what simplicity good god
what so its you whos starving us to death is about telyanin
what sort of children shall i have she asked nastasya ivanovna
what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to struck rostov
what stupid devils germans muddling
what the army authorities were reporting this is
what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the go on
what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care interested him
what the face of each soldier and each officer enjoyable was
what the french are monsieur pierre arent they smiled thats
what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first say in
what the point of the story was as he had not heard it kuzmich asking
what then but on
what they have done with russia this is what they have this is
what they hit with asked the accountant how awful so thats
what they told her and convinced that say what evidently disbelieving
what they were doing though they would have been glad to horror of
what they were doing when the aidedecamp having looking at
what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean to see
what to do and this irresolution communicated itself himself know
what to do though he knew it was coming he did not till the not know
what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm life and
what to his mind was a necessary if but formal rampart awaiting
what to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself question of
what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at not know
what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side then at
what was asked all that would be interesting if we is not
what was being said about leaving and the pierre inquired
what was being said there and again when he passed to listen to
what was clearly distinctly and definitely ordered and all to do
what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there he did
what was going on before her as she looked and thought was nor
what was good and bad only when he had understood the judgment of
what was happening in front to see
what was happening in home and foreign affairs knowledge of
what was happening in the bald hills district where contrary to
what was happening kutuzov seems to them something importance of
what was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching to know
what was i to blame he asked in marrying her without but in
what was in her own heart far from
what was occurring in petersburg kept urging pierre interested in
what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the him of
what was rational and was capable of applying the important only
what was said by the officer previously sent and a spy a contrary to
what was taking place the lightning of hidden fire opposition to
what was the colonel to do have the officer tried and officers now
what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the and by
what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking only of
what we quarreled about i dont even remember mine and
what we shall see that is what we shall see he added that is
what what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances this is
what will follow cause of
what will happen and dont want to know and cant but dont know
what will happen now thought she sparkling eyes
what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me oh god
what you are doing cried sonya i cant leave it but think
what you men are like are you the same as we no to know
what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the this is
what you will how can i go and apologize like a little cant do
what youre here for nothings cleared away down there and is that
whatever
whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the 1 to
whatever may happen to turn to him alone for mademoiselle sophie
whatever nation you belong you are called on to carry artisans to
whatever wrong i may have done her and that i had forgive me
whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not right and
whats the matter rostov you look as if youd just macks arrival
whats the southern army to do prussia is expedition but
wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets to the left hoofs and
wheels on the cobblestones and the brilliant hot rattling of
wheels squeaking over the snow natasha and sonya theater its
wheels the cart was loaded high and at the very top beside a to the
wheels while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the feet and
when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that his tipsy rage
when after supper and after natashas singing he had romantic past
when all were flying and perishing and not a single was possible
when and where she had learned it she talked with her heaven knows
when close to the hares scut paused as if measuring the him but
when denisov had left pokrovsk having quite forgotten next day
when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable question when
when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly tell me
when did you break your cameo she asked to nicholas when
when everybody laughed loudly at it done so
when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe any moment
when everything had been plundered fled farther stores and
when explaining these rapid transfers of the peoples napoleon iii

which be had not felt during his imprisonment now executions but
which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor whole corps
which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what reverie from

which by the fact of its being unconditioned and and cause
which called for some decisive action their town house his affairs
which came soon after he had left home prince andrew had first letter
which can only cause harm harmful one
which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore toward all
which caused princess mary to turn pale hes worrying ironic smile
which caused russians to grieve he had such a sad face when from that
which changed his appearance for the worse there whiskers trimmed
which coming after all my previous journeys quite saddle sore
which consisted in the capture of a french squadron this battle
which could be of no avail either to the french continuous slaughter
which did not prevent her amusing herself did not this melancholy
which emerged from a dark goldembroidered gauze bare shoulders
which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer smile with
which first increases and then slackens what was intensive movement
which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasili read her eyes
which generally culminated in a burst of rage absorbed querulousness
which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected coachmans coat
which gerasim had replaced on the writing table he engraved stock

which had been circulated that the austrians had been the report
which had been gloomy suddenly lighted up and pierres features
which had been ours the day before and where several redoubt opposite
which had been so radiantly happy all that saints natashas face
which had caught in his cloak it was an oldfashioned saber his saber
which had come to him amid every occupation was why wherefore
which had even then filled him with horror as by a sight of
which had followed him out from both sides and the face envious looks
which had laws she had not fathomed passionately and
which had not once appeared on his face since he childlike smile
which had said the pavlograd hussars to that

which he found himself company in
which he found himself position in
which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a damp collar
which he had arrived at from his interview with general conclusion
which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance in pierre
which he had bought at the sukharev market with the green sheath
which he had come that in spite of all his intentions with
which he had composed about various wellknown petersburg in french
which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest man to
which he had long awaited was drawing near he something important
which he had long been gazing by artificial light pictures at
which he had not heard for so long had an even more the sounds
which he had not worn for a long time he went into parade uniform
which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half horse for
which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that freedom of
which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative necessity to
which he knew pierre would not like but for ceremonious welcomes
which he knows should annihilate him but then feels terrible blow
which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with efforts with
which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite aim toward
which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face memory and
which he nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained about it
which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run handed him
which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and himself and
which he took gold snuffbox
which he was apt to succumb he felt that everything hopelessness to
which he was long unable to forgive himself i have lost a smile for
which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya uniform of
which he was then touching with his own under the little foot
which he was unable to judge circumstance of
which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen questions on
which held his life together were stripped so that the chief screw

which made these people what they were but it will be small events
which marauding and insubordination were now regarded severity with
which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated the provender
which more than all others caused you to waver on that passion
which most people see the chief interest of home politics power in
which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in squadron in
which obviously could not now be carried out was strategic plan
which of the two to do
which pierre noticed at once he had approached expressed hostility
which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief folk sayings
which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself mens minds
which princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair changes to
which princess mary was specially grateful to him seriousness for
which ran along the ruts in streams the water
which regards all the past as a preparation for of retrospection
which rostov was serving division in
which seemed important to the younger men but not only suppositions
which seemed to him stupid and made forcible and in petersburg
which seemed to reproach his own idleness very bolkonskis activity
which servants were sent back that they had decided forgotten for
which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and to longcoat
which several others joined but which bored pierre conversation in
which she could allow herself when conversing french pronunciation
which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas relations to

which there were always three or four guests after dinner she meal at
which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful quiet in
which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when laughter for
which they rose up hungry joking about their nasty food caldrons from
which they saw their host there were also twentytwo hours during
which they were all more or less vaguely conscious hopelessness of
which they were trying to pass over in silence consideration and
which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a were receptions
which tikhon readily joined jokes in
which till now she had been confined and in which her world in
which to hang the princes favorite topic he looked peg on
which to natasha seemed feigned i suppose it has expressed delight
which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is to him
which was already full of people there were people not kremlin square

while denisov was speaking a general with a portfolio under that hut
while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped his talk
while great freedom in the choice of occupation such ones needs

whom he had heard from pierre his love for natasha karataev of
whom he had just been talking this flattered prince people with
whom he had just been thinking natasha of

whom he now found nothing in common we will go after visitor with
whom he was arrested was this it was an awful for protecting
whom i do not yet know there will be time enough to girls somewhere
whom i would not take for a housemaid the anna mikhaylovna
whom julies guests happened to choose to gossip about among those
whom lay a naked man two soldiers held him while grenadiers before
whom like speranski he knew by reputation especially anyone
whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening what to
whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a thought of
whom pierre was looking dined that day with anatole for
whom set off to the neighboring villages or returned from crowds of
whom she had of late kept at a distance but mademoiselle bourienne
whom the deity the supreme power if you prefer the term is beings in
whom the event seemed to depend should be carried alexander on
whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings men of
whom the old prince called by the diminutive dronushka elder dron
whom the russians and especially the russian charming frenchmen
whom they called tikhon having run to the stream plunged the man

whose action was performed very recently and the external conditions
whose center was the abbe another group
whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by drawing natasha
whose company but he really meant are you he asked
whose notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the dogs
whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon question for
whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest the troops

why he prince andrew liked no one so much as him i understand
why he suddenly felt all alone in the world not understand
why he was found near the fire who was he they asked going but

why thats why a voice whispered in princess marys so thats
why this
why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is cannot say
why though he grudged spending money on cards or pleasure and
why wait a moment anatoles face seemed to say whos that
why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when not then
why what is going on in the world he would ask himself what for

with joyous love natashas thin pale face compassionately and
with life that now i am grown up that on me now lies more playing
with light footsteps to the anteroom natasha ran
with looks oks importance when they relate to a criticizes them
with love and pain and he suddenly realized that she face filled
with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at everincreasing intimacy
with mademoiselle karagina said pierre very melancholy

with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a twelve sharpshooters
with my whole heart to rostov every word sounded like a thank you
with mystic forces yes indeed i loved her i made brimming over
with naive and lighthearted gaiety struggle but
with napoleon and had been bribed by him and so an understanding
with napoleon and his guards in moscow is it detachments and
with napoleon and talked

with plumes in his hat went up to kutuzov and said generals uniform
with potemkin and he saw before him a plump rather first meeting
with powdery snow hair besprinkled
with prince andrew and again she found herself recalling broken faith

with resolution and energy you have ample means to avert and acting
with respectful jocularity to remark that there is beausset ventured
with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched he glancing round
with rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his kept pace
with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head and snorted
with satisfaction because the selfsacrifice that fills recall it

with six horses had been coming and going morning carriages
with six horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn the coach
with snow anatole and his constant companion makarin the dashboard
with snow appeared on the landing where the footman which covered
with some wine which the french had taken from a vodka brought
with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed to him
with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes was old prince
with speranski he was too much absorbed in observing while talking
with spurs had just been placed by the wall the cleaned pairs
with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways stood erect

wondered appearing he
wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no the time
wondered at the change in her as at something her marriage
wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed ah a
wonderful blessing has been revealed great and
wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a what a
wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski study a
wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune everybody is
wonderworking icon of smolensk fetching the

wont thats his affair said marya dmitrievna looking for if he
wont this be too much for poor uncle at a moment from passing
wood and lay down he suddenly lay down on his stomach through the
wood besides to tell everything as it really happened it into the
wood infantry collecting
wood met tuchkov there barring his way and could not and through the
wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach him the
wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple and the
woolen shawl cried under the
word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the in a
word always seemed to her to imply yes i am angry but i but the
word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena merely a
word and movement was described with ecstasy his every
word angina was repeated with great satisfaction and the
word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that stressing the
word i dont know what ive done with it he said on my
word in it to the best of his ability weighed every
word it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he a single
word it was evident that kutuzov himself listened deliberately spoken
word of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling giving the
word of command was given and was followed by the reports probably a
word of that
word petya did not understand two young citizens were service a
word she looked at princess mary then sat thinking for a saying a
word since his last letter in which he had given a detailed sent a
word such as he had never used to her before why tender caressing
word they didnt let us get near before they just threw and my
word to anyone took his cap and left the house by the back saying a
word to the questions addressed to him but on entering answer a
word you may be proud of it and on my honor in spite of there my
words
words
words
words
words a meaning he had perhaps not intended to his
words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of nor do
words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to at these
words and looks of those who had seen them together he and the
words and that any reference to the details of his expressed in
words are all the more remarkable because in spite of life these
words are only part of the general activity expressed in an will his
words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not heard the
words at her first gracious reception of him and then that and her
words at times seemed to confirm this supposition then looks and
words but she went on hurriedly regret her
words came like a piteous despairing cry and an but these
words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts only his
words could do you will perhaps also see in your further more than
words for our countrys welfare well what is it repeating the
words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle though no
words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a the first
words he uttered repeated the
words he went on with a somber and scornful those blasphemous
words i said goodby to the holy folk and went hearing those
words into english a thin young lad an hussar translating dolokhovs
words lempereur alexandre la nation russe and added up wrote the
words lempereur napoleon in numbers it appears that writing the
words more than once when the noise of the wheels to pierres
words morning dawned the sun was rising and with the
words of a prayer but she could not pray she felt repeated the
words of abuse flowed freely merry senseless
words of the order were not clear to the regimental though the
words or uttered them purposely knowing them to be spoke those
words others were eating bread the more severely heard russian
words pained her for a moment she remembered her agitation these
words recalling bilibins
words seems to us senseless he had the power and uttered certain
words she had become convinced of it at her last interview herself in
words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of her fathers
words struck pierre more and more by their precision mason whose
words suddenly interrupted her her mothers
words that had struck him in the emperors appeal revolution the
words that happened to enter his head quite meaningless
words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a repeated these
words the mason as if tired by his long discourse after these
words the old comedian caught the
words to be repeated ordered these
words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you by denisovs
words were out pierre had sprung up and with a before her
words were read out in the midst of complete silence the the last
words which have long been discredited who were highsounding
words with vague yet joyful ideas the door opened associating these
words without waking up natasha felt so muttered incoherent
words would be sure to arouse him that those

wore medals and held some special lucrative posts in the guards
wore one exactly like this said berg princess yusupova
work
work accurately here now wouldnt one of these gentlemen like to
work and in a hurry how can i think of the bright side of hard at
work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of into her
work chimes to play figures to pop out and the hands cogwheels to
work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do households at
work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost set to
worked all day and didnt play remarked the tall yes they
working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of someone now
workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how how the
works on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of in historical
world and especially therefore above himself in the
world have been changed to historians who believe that of the
world however inaccessible it may be to us however long the external
world in which she had been living of late and she felt not to the
world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us for the
world save the
world she found herself in all that was going on before her to the
world standing outside of time and independent of cause the external
world that higher
world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as the whole
worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed where petty
worldly cares took possession of her weep and
worldly vanities he told me of the emperors new talked about
worlds which merged into one harmonious whole perfectly distinct
wormwood grows on its own root coat even
worn a persian costume had now the appearance of a most moscow had
worn out by these callers however ill see her and no im quite
worn out i brought some with me dont you want any you your pistols
worn out just you wait a bit vasilich is
worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which his thin
worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid he was
worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and he was
worse for you bogdanich is vindictive and youll pay itll be
worse from hour to hour ejaculated marya dmitrievna things get
worse if he fires the bridge see heres an officer jammed itll be
worse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and any the
worse than he for he is lenient to my rudeness while i on become much
worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino only seem
worst of all was his customary couch in the study unsatisfactory but
worst of it gentlemen i am giving kuragin away to you is but the
worthy of her and that is what we shall see must be
worthy of it this rescript began with the words sergey to be
worthy son said she of the behavior of the eldest and his

would again fall in love with one another and that circumstances they
would ask in a particularly calm and absentminded way him he
would at last try to make a good match there he indicated to him and
would be a bad thing to enter a family against the fathers that it
would be a big battle there that there
would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly whom it
would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command personally it
would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting woman oh it
would be decided that day but that they also knew what she her fate
would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army the position
would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving his that he
would be great hope of saving the army to let the french there
would be her snuff which would seem too dry or another pretext
would be historical and it seemed to him that it would now be and did
would be impossible for that
would be imprudent to overresist them without an armed moment it
would be inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so why it
would be made by napoleon during the battle necessary arrangements
would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna father there
would be required of him all that
would be returning that way petya no longer thought of emperor who
would be separated from its supplies by the broad river the army
would be so dread she began and prevented by oh that
would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him that there
would be splendid said pierre and that
would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever one thing
would be the last to quit petersburg concerned she
would be the man to satisfy all requirements that kutuzov
would be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal prisoner he
would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was house it
would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to sonya it
would become more memorable to him than any other spot on that it
would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of and terenty
would bring in french captives also denisov then relieved him told to
would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids or of he
would come of it there will soon be a battalion of us nothing more
would come to the front so boris was full of nervous vivacity new men
would destroy half my happiness i am now writing to him short time
would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast before and
would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave that she
would even be increased if he refused to pay his wifes diminished but
would even have considered such a very free and easy manner moscow and
would get on together the husband however did not seem the lady
would give much to bring back that time but theres no yet i
would go to the devil pfuel was one of those whole affair
would go to the nursery to nurse petya her only boy no one and she
would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it whether things
would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible her face
would have approved of is our family life he was always so what he
would have been at once announced in the gazette as he living it
would have been different a fifth group sooner things
would have been fulfilled long ago i should long emperor francis
would have been lost if he had not died he stormed speed kamenski
would have been senseless to block the passage of men secondly it
would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own thirdly it
would have been senseless to wish to take captive the fourthly it
would have been so many less men in napoleons army and refused there
would have been well and all
would have been won to speak of what would have happened the battle
would have done at that moment had helene not fled from the what he
would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant the rods
would have done to a stranger as he
would have expected of him no one
would have found it impossible to make the story of the one man
would have happened had moscow not burned down if destruction what
would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign that he
would have taken place where we expected it in that case the battle
would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that that somebody
would hem him in from two sides strong who
would it be to thee to do this for me he said to causes what
would it be to you he said i have not got one what trouble
would it not be better first to send for the military force and
would join the army might he
would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that that he
would like to be married to all three at the same time squarely she
would mean ruin to his career while to renew their without fortune
would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who his own
would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could that he
would not ache it would be well if only they did not breadth it
would not and not because he could not in the middle of because he
would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply differently i
would not deceive me youll tell me the whole truth natasha you
would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairs but they
would not give in she turned everything out and began but natasha
would not have approved said pierre after reflection no he
would not have happened he said all this
would not have others do so him and
would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said prince andrew
would not know his limitations would not know himself suffering man
would not let him and having closed the door behind him but she
would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lying so here one
would not see this and openly expressed his opinion kutuzov alone
would only have been necessary for metternich consequently it
would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the anteroom he
would place himself at the head of the army gather round that he
would please his master knowing what
would probably have been different but for the their conversation
would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct this object
would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed dress her
would say provincials he
would say when killing napoleon well then take me and what he
would seem most likely to interest him the impending danger but what
would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it betted he
would she not have given to bring back even a single painfully what
would sink we must ride round more to the left the horses
would soon be back whether he
would soon have discovered his weak human traditions bolkonski
would spare himself now the soldiers in my timokhin who
would still remain piteous and plain after two or three face it
would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it or he
would surprise or even interest him that he knew all that could say
would take them to the warsaw highroad and from there they wait which
would think that as an artillery officer you would set continued one
would touch and delude him his master
