a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
a stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash
a stout dark redfaced peasant in the forties with thick lips a
a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him and
a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this

a stranger this was the marshal of the nobility of the district
a subject near to her own heart she could not reconcile herself to

abandoning moscow and the commander in chiefs rival the man who
abandoning the attempt i cant prove it to you you say that
abandoning their property while the poorer remained and burned and
abandoning them
abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built
abandonment and burning of moscow and tried with his puny hand now to

abandonment of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger
abandonment of smolensk to the enemy it is pitiable and sad and

absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his

absorbed in his mastery of the matter
absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the

ahead of others and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of
aid of a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not
aid of a servant from there they passed into another room a man in
aidedecamp
aidedecamp dat one liffs after de sird stroke
aidedecamp followed by a cossack
aidedecamp of napoleons there were also several french officers of
aidedecamp picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped the
aidesdecamp and adjutants but this is what well do i have a
aidesdecamp passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a
aim now was to test the cadets courage so he drew himself up and
aim of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment or
aim of our order which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice
aim of the movement of humanity he might have arranged matters
aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite
aim was the dissemination of ideas the printing press could have
aim was to show general weyrother who had read his dispositions
aimlessly moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of
aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain
aims they were moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant
aims to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of
air a man told me to give you this and she handed natasha a
air as he pointed at the old men with his free hand
air in columns no flames were seen but columns of smoke rose on
air was sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began
air was still warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a
akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she
alarm and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity
alarm could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french
alarmed at denisovs condition rostov suggested that he should
alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its
albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a
alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander
alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to
alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites
alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the
alexander did not desire war and had no relations with england
alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because
alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the
alexander he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his
alexander hurriedly to kutuzov glancing courteously at the same
alexander i the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
alexander i the pacifier of europe the man who from his early
alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from
alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his friend
alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be carried
alexander or in general of the persons they describe the answers
alexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors and
alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be
alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so on
alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle
alexanders court but it was not much appreciated at napoleons
alexanders errors and duplicity
alexanders eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to
alexanders eyes as if asking whether he should stand there or go
alexanders guards said the first one indicating a russian
alexanders power into the components talleyrand chateaubriand
alexanders regime had weakened and a patriotic and antifrench
alexanders time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility and the
alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his

alexeevich i told my wife that i begged her to forget the past to
alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm
alexeevichs letters and recalled my conversations with him and
alexeevichs study he really found it when he sat with his elbows
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world
alike he said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man
alike were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most
aliment de poison dune ame trop sensible
aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about
alive a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface
alive could understand or explain
alive he had forgotten she was dead and tikhon reminded him that she
all about it at the courtmartial then he turned to pierre do
all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite
all administrators that he controlled the external actions of
all and that if he loved natasha he might dispense with permission
all and without promising to help me thought pierre rising with
all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army
all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy
all around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all
all as in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the
all at once did not know how to do it but again the sense that she
all at once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and

all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days
all came to see him tried to ingratiate themselves with him and it
all carried on by vis inertiae pressed forward into boats and into
all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
all comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natasha noticed at
all communication with such men as klyucharev and i will knock the
all criminals and so thinks timokhin and the whole army they

all her invitations without exception written in french and
all her neighbors as christ loved mankind countess marys soul

all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she
all his men felt the same excitement

all his time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by

all meant to represent but it was so pretentiously false and
all men not only the french but all europe except england which does
all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is

all moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is
all moscow that everyone will say that you drunk and not knowing
all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew

all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered
all sides and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast
all spies and bring them to him and now reproached them for doing so
all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with
all stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety voice began to
all take glasses you too balaga well comrades and friends of my
all that confusion what did or did not happen
all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that
all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he
all that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the
all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves
all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the
all that he had heard as he used afterwards to say and gave
all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee
all that is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be
all that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even
all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it
all that night count rostopchin issued orders for which people came
all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor
all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between
all that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are
all that was done around her and to her at this time all the
all that was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy
all that would be required of him
all the armies and the whole region powers no commander in chief ever
all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory
all the childrens property you said yourself that we have a
all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in
all the depth of their national feeling then the role chosen by
all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the
all the dishes wines and kinds of dessert in order to send a full
all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were
all the enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight home
all the evening nicholas paid attention to a blueeyed plump and
all the experience of old cunctators
all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm
all the fear before action which he had experienced as previously all
all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the
all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude
all the hunt who had been moving slowly shouted stop calling
all the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
all the kings except the chinese wear military uniforms and he
all the law courts of the world but which those who committed them
all the means at my command i shall let my beard grow to here he
all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a
all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations
all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with
all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that
all the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people
all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly
all the pleasanter for him because after his loss to dolokhov for
all the points of our position are in the enemys hands and we
all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and
all the present quicker quicker and that they should leave me in
all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon
all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his benefactors
all the revenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally
all the rules as if there were any rules for killing people in spite
all the rules of art one can imagine what confusion and obscurity
all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class
all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal
all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807
all the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh
all the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all i
all the same i shant sleep what silliness to sleep mummy
all the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the
all the same now thought he and what will be there and what has
all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third
all the same the governors wife went on with her matchmaking passing
all the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperor
all the same to the next house which seemed to them better many of
all the societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new
all the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel he
all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for
all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka
all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
all the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it
all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained
all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with
all the women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole
all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love
all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home
all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as
all their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the
all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished
all these events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if
all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in
all these occupations as hindrances to life and considered that
all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some
all things to his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the
all this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows
all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so
all this information when the enemy has scattered his forces in large
all this is absolutely true
all this is that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at
all this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could
all this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et
all this seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow
all this the soldiers of denisovs squadron fed chiefly on
all this time and of no use to anyone while she felt herself so
all this time natasha sat silent glancing up at him from under
all this was the fruit of anisya fedorovnas housekeeping
all this would not have happened he said
all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any
all to the fact
all turned their attention to the glow
all vera was twentyfour had been taken out everywhere and though
all vill pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as pooossible
all was
all we can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of
all well asked rostov drawing away his arm
all were silent
all were silent
all were silent and the only sound audible was the heavy
all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it
all were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones
all were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of the
all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile
all were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way
all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two
all where it is you must know we will take it at once and show it to
all who came from the field of battle and of those who stood around
all wight all wight shouted denisov its no good making
all with grapeshot shouted the officer
all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers
all with very few exceptions
all without exception respected and feared her
all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with
all yes it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is
all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and
alleged insanity of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when
allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage of holy friendship of
alley alley said the cossack touching the prisoners arm to
allforgiving expression on her face stood by the door near the
alliance
alliance with england and when your position is a bad one you
alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if
allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old
allies it might perhaps have been a long time before this
allies the poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight

allowed napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so when was it
allowed to live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its

allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and
allowing the family groups to divide into separate households he
allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his
alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time
allusion to the name of the sovereign three hundred persons took
allusions to his happiness he often surprised those he met by his
ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the

almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor lay a
almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment
almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodino the bridge

almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through
almost frightened eyes as she passed him
almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out he
almost in love with this woman who was so beautiful and so kind
almost insane unprofitable to himself to the count and to the
almost morbid irritation
almost quarreled with her brother about him she insisted that he

alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she rang
alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute
alone but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they
alone came from various sides of the crowd

alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present
alone had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hair
alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been
alone in the country
alone leave me alone i hate you
alone love is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall

alone understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general
alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her
alone with her but had never spoken to her of love now he felt
alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to
along and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows
along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms there was a

and all eyes were raised to the count
and all he said that it was necessary to await provisions or that
and all napoleons attempts at conciliation were discussed in that
and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he
and all that follows therefrom
and all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and
and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess
and all would have been well
and along the road trying not to miss anything of importance
and alpatych
and alpatych is being sent to smolensk asked princess mary
and alpatych watched for it too
and already corded up others still empty
and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the

and having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that
and having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and
and having entered on the path of definition of which he was
and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to
and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave
and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut
and having lain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french
and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him
and having thus demolished the young man anna pavlovna turned to
and having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silence
and he again turned to pierre
and he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry
and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame
and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince
and he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes
and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the
and he fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was
and he flirted with a few of them at the balls but he did not run
and he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he

and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it
and he has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to
and he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i
and he himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and
and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch
and he is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the
and he is still alive and gay
and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it but an
and he laughed unnaturally
and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and
and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of
and he left the room the countess began to cry
and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he
and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and
and he released bolkonskis arm to indicate that he had now quite
and he said hast thou noticed that my face is different i looked
and he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who
and he sat down at the nearest table
and he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he
and he showed a bag a hundred flints i bought them very cheap
and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet
and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever princess
and he walked on
and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not
and he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the
and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of
and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull
and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the
and hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency
and heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas
and heavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french
and heir apparent from the army who on his own authority and
and helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the
and helped them in as he was putting natasha in he pressed her arm
and her churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her
and her face suddenly became serious but this lasted only a second
and her hair was done the same way as the day before yet she was
and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawingroom with the
and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no
and her mother and several other less noteworthy persons
and her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak
and her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join
and her sons were all in the service
and her soul was not visible at all all that struck the eye was a
and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him
and her words at her first gracious reception of him and then that
and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all
and heres the commander said likhachev
and heroism and did i do it for my countrys sake and how was he
and highly valued the old count came up to them and pressed
and himself moving naturally imagines that his efforts move the
and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions
and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving
and his associates had scope for its development in africa
and his companion they became silent and pierre thought he saw the
and his excitement at the same moment natasha without drawing
and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy
and his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on
and his familys and his friends and the enemys intention to
and his fingers twitched nervously
and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were
and his horse two wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred
and his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed
and his knowledge of men kutuzov having taken into consideration the
and his life twenty times a year and in their service had lost more
and his own most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders
and his presence there natasha had resolved to see him she did not
and his present sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted
and his son
and his son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he
and his strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted
and his thoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was sitting by
and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh
and his wifes delight now they ran out into the porch and reported
and his worthy son said she of the behavior of the eldest
and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity
and holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his
and honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on
and hope were given her by gods folk the halfwitted and other
and hoped for nothing and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy
and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened
and horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that
and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him
and how about you count peter kirilych if they call up the
and how can sonya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so
and how could she have a love letter from him in her hand
and how could you believe he was my lover why because i like
and how deep how bright and glorious was the setting sun with what
and how did they arrest you dear lad at your house
and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkov
and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring
and how does one do it in a barn inquired sonya
and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband
and how like one another said ilyin
and how she dances what gwace he said again after a pause
and how weve been begging your honor said the old soldier
and hows it youre not afraid sir really now a redfaced
and hows your father
and hunger virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of
and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and
and hurrah for the whole world

and in each soldier
and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once on
and in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news
and in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his
and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she
and in general food for the men the younger ones occupied
and in graves does not even interest them for it does not come within
and in moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after
and in number as a result of which the superiority had passed to
and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
and in the expression on their faces one of them glanced timidly at

and independently of herself while her face beamed with ecstatic
and indicating the rostovs box on seeing natasha pierre grew
and indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room
and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure
and infinite in everything and therefore to see it and enjoy its
and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks
and instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage
and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the

and into the avenue a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were
and intoxicatingly so after his long privations at posting
and intriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves
and involuntarily began to compare these two men so different and

and involuntarily stopped

and their assistants of whom there were but few moved about among
and their coming to petersburg and the likeness between natasha and
and their hunger as usual in their spare time they lit bonfires
and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events
and their voices trembled a dance for which her partner came to seek
and their wellbrushed clothes there was a masculine odor and a smell
and themselves there are some semiprivate longestablished jokes and

and then addressed pierre
and then as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him

and then his attention wandered from the book and the square and he
and then how he had asked her about boris
and then i would make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyes how

and there hasnt been anyone in the room except the lieutenant
and there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea
and there seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied by the
and there was a smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong
and there were as many advisers there as here he went on
and thereby to render them capable of receiving it
and therefore this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we
and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would
and theres nothing for you to say i shall speak to him myself
and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain
and these simple words her look and the expression on her face
and they announce a victory supposing that the more people they
and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand oh yes let me
and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero a
and they could not cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four
and they disappeared into the darkness with with their load
and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all
and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their
and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye
and they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierre
and thinking of that
and thinking without doing anything which seemed to them
and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev
and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly
and this is gratitude this is recognition for those who have
and this man and that man did not execute such and such maneuvers
and this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the
and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet
and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest
and this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying
and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may the
and those of them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his
and those who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors
and though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a
and though prince vasili when he stayed in as he said for
and though they entitled one another majesties highnesses or
and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip
and through him obtain a special grant nor did he say to himself
and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color
and thud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and
and tidied themselves up after their journey marya dmitrievna
and tikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next
and tikhon understanding him wiped away the tears
and till then considered a chefdoeuvre of tactical science which
and time to go to bed
and titi once more at the same time he felt that above his face
and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count
and to all denisovs persuasions petya replied that he too was
and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and
and to control them without their being aware of it in a word we
and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians
and to do that order and strictness are essential thats all
and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel
and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced
and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of ones needs good food
and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he
and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me and he
and to the governors in the offices and shops and at the post office
and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the
and told her he had long wished to have this happiness ever since the
and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her during the
and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her
and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the
and told stories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual
and told the count such vile disgraceful things about us
and took her hand
and trembled with emotion this meeting immediately struck rostov as a
and trembling were silently doing something to this mans other gory
and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would
and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding
and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable
and tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he
and triumph
and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked
and trying to take from him a foxfur coat he vaguely understood that
and turned to look at pierre
and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed
and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting
and tutti quanti you will agree that if you did not look after
and twenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had been
and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned
and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm
and two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor
and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing
and undertaken something new but after a four days halt the mob
and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that
and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the
and unexpectedly again began to cry
and unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he
and unpleasant
and unworthy then our talk turned to the interpretation of the
and utter one of his mots
and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man but i know on
and vereshchagin
and very quickly he stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his
and violence why because the duke was wronged thousands of men
and wagged his head approvingly
and wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone
and wait for me
and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions
and was about to cross the space between the barriers when dolokhov
and was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the
and was afraid of doing so
and was angrily searching for fleas baring his yellow teeth and
and was breathless when pierre spoke to him he did not miss a
and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the
and was hated by the commune must be hesitating between the two
and was herself horrified at what she had said
and was ivanushka with you
and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress
and was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village
and was our militia of any use to the empia not at all it only
and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark
and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before
and was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general said
and was told that his turn would come in due course after some others
and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to
and we my dear boy its terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack
and we were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the hussar the hussar
and weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking
and welcome for the approaching chief
and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will
and wellbred count rostov among the men was an italian prisoner
and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the
and went away natasha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and
and went for a ride to try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find
and went in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and
and went out to pay visits and then only to the most important
and went straight to the house
and went to the carriage
and went to the lodging occupied by boris and zhilinski
and went with her into the unoccupied room
and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of
and wept she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he
and were as much occupied with evening parties dinners lunches
and were at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the
and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it
and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day
and were related to her meeting with rostov
and were talking patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step
and what a wellpreserved man he was remarked the aidedecamp
and what about his character asked the regimental commander
and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the
and what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed
and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at
and what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on
and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to
and what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at his
and what was played was a fugue though petya had not the least
and what were you going to say
and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans
and whats your name
and when alone with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever left
and when and where
and when are we to start your excellency
and when belova replied oh yes theyve come she would mutter
and when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the
and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip
and when our armies did unite he was displeased that smolensk was
and when she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit
and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the pretext would be
and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be
and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a
and where is your brotherinlaw now if i may ask he said
and wheres the fur cloak asked dolokhov hey ignatka go to
and whether she ought to write tormented her now that he was already
and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates
and which he was unable to arrest a personal human feeling for a
and which now allured him a splendid wife children a good pack
and which therefore affected her very strongly she was sure he
and while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with
and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted
and white hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to helene and
and who are you
and who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy
and who has told you what is bad for another man he asked
and who is is this she asked her governess peering into the face
and who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently
and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexanders
and who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper
and whom he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept
and why and at the sight the old man turned angrily away
and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a
and why are they stopping theres no proper order said the
and why didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have
and why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i
and why do they all speak of a military genius is a man a genius
and why do you serve
and why do you stand there gaping
and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what
and why he had come or what was happening to her when she saw his
and why is it
and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked
and wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity
and wife felt with satisfaction that even if only one guest was
and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness
and will do so so you see there can be no question about said
and will she soon be confined and shaking his head
and winding down and up rose higher and higher to the village of
and wiped his eyes at the sight
and wish you to have as good an opinion of me dont upset yourself
and wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking
and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room
and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door
and with a frenchmans easy and naive frankness the captain told
and with a furtive glance at his sons face the count went out of
and with a hooked nose then came two more and many more running
and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke
and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been
and with a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another
and with a quiet long easy yet resolute lope
and with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that
and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
and with baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his
and with bated breath and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight
and with dignity and the deacon is the same what holiness is there
and with galoshes on his bare feet stood in the anteroom on seeing
and with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and
and with sonyas love and his promise to her it was all dreadfully
and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat well goodby
and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment
and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised
and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room
and without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table
and without concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day not
and without consulting anyones tastes or rules and regardless of
and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at
and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stepped
and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the
and word that filled his soul with joy
and working the screws himself
and workshops so the first task pierre had to face was one for
and worn heavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her
and worst of all i am growing old thats the thing there wont
and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing
and would on no account have told a deliberate lie he began his story
and would you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo
and wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow
and wounded who it seemed to him caught at his feet but before he
and wrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side
and wrinkled soles and palms
and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four
and yet angry his showing under his black mustache id have
and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
and yet could not cease to ask himself it was as if the thread of the
and yet everything is so strange so strange i cant make it out i
and yet hes such an affectionate father said countess mary
and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked
and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had
and you all listen to me said rostov to the peasants be off
and you are you going to have lunch too they feed you quite
and you are you one of the doctors

anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew
anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that
anna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the
anna pavlovnas an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire
anna pavlovnas at home was like the former one only the
anna pavlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this
anna pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling the highest

at him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile
at him without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be
at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck
at his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to

at one moment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that
at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded
at or listen to them and among all these faces that he found so
at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to

at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house
at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the

at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon
at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one

at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his
at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from

at the door and natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing

at the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful
at the envoy hurrying past them
at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the
at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting petya lashed his
at the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardino
at the fleches the smoke spread out before them and at times it
at the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving
at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a

at the great battle of la moskowa sacre dieu it was splendid that
at the gypsies and more than one thousand rubles of their money
at the halfopen door of the corridor intending to conceal himself as
at the icons with a sigh this might have been taken as an
at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout
at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he
at the lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would
at the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more
at the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table berg
at the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre
at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road
at the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with
at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid
at the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to
at the next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold
at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed
at the patches appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the
at the porch carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving
at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he
at the razumovskis ball and countess apraksina i was so
at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he
at the rostovs had jocularly assumed the role of natashas knight
at the same time
at the same time a large proportion of human error comes from the
at the same time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of
at the same time his motherinlaw prince vasilis wife sent to
at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic
at the same time only the skeleton of life remained his house a

at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
at the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to
at the sound like the yelp of a dog with which denisov turned
at the sound of weyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an

at the spot where pierres face had been before he sat down anna
at the squadron commander awaiting the word of command a second
at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who
at the tea table on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a
at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins
at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father
at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and
at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a
at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had
at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our
at the very instant he did this and uttered those words pierre felt
at the village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn
at the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the
at the way he danced that evening he had never danced like that in
at the will of him who governs men and worlds continued
at their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying
at them and hack them to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful
at them and hear them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill
at them she looked at the faces of the audience seeking in them
at these sounds long unheard rostovs spirits rose as at the
at these words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to
at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas
at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated
at this bright comet which having traveled in its orbit with
at this last ball only the ecossaise the anglaise and the mazurka
at this moment petya to whom nobody was paying any attention came
at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so
at this table chose and placed cards and watched those broadboned
at three oclock in the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked
at times as if to allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed
at tula and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its
at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having
at two oclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner
at ulm it is he seemed to be trying to find the right
at valuevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the
at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news
at what oclock did the battle begin asked the emperor
at what oclock they started thought prince andrew watching his old
at what oclock was general schmidt killed
at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally
at which it had been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no
at which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers
at which they were present and went to iogels balls for young people
at you like a target
at your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have
atmosphere
atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostovs house as at
atmosphere of these latrines
atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and
atmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses
atmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknown
attach to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group
attached what is it i am attached to papa said anatole
attaching them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the
attachments and friendships he is a man who has been more than a
attachments could she like other women vera meant herself
attachments friendships or love as pierre understood them but
attack commence on the right wing
attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several
attack employed his whole strength to restrain the russian army
attack for a whole month napoleons position is most brilliant he
attack for they are not moving it cant be a square for they are
attack in order to cut away through for themselves
attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his
attack the fleches to lead his division through the woods napoleon
attack the french right wing
attack this point but on each occasion had been driven back by
attack which now seeing how near they were to the french he
attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he
attacked by stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers
attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra what
attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when
attacking and in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms
attacking at vyazma and tarutino
attacking dron and so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier
attacking the french at the beginning of the battle they stood
attain peace but which only wounded the selflove of both sides
attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not
attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger
attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man just as the
attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary
attend and asking them all to be seated began
attend prince andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this
attend to ones own work and he did his work giving his whole
attend to the business i am old i
attend to the estate and would would be in better spirits and temper
attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into
attended by two mounted dragoons
attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting ill speak to lise
attention
attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily
attention and his face wore a strained look as if he found it
attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she
attention because his opponent took advantage of it how much more
attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such
attention dohkturov a little man sat opposite weyrother with an
attention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun
attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening
attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by
attention of soandso but she did not even see the emperor and only
attention shouted the regimental commander in a soulshaking
attention that never wandered evidently herself experiencing all that
attention that was being paid to her read the last words
attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool but also a
attention to her nephew who had entered the room
attention to his story
attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply
attention to the sound of the princes footsteps stepping flat on
attention was diverted by the everincreasing crowds moving toward the
attention was engrossed by watching the family circle separated
attention with eager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look
attentively and scrutinizingly at her she asked herself in
attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach on
attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters written in a
attitude in moscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgel
attitude into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped
attitude toward her she did not even notice the special attentions
attitude toward him that had taken place in society
attitude with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or
attitude with one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which
attract his attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on
attracted by a small brown dog coming heaven knows whence which
attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground
attracted him to her but by something else indefinite but firm as
attracted prince andrew
attracted to the ruling circles where the future on which the fate of
attracting to it as the first movement had done the nations of
attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue but man who is
attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his
attractive it is all very well for rostov whose father sends him
attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and
attributed great importance to make up for this at home pierre had
attributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in
attributes

boris in the accurate way characteristic of him was building a
boris is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what
boris kissed natashas hand and said that he was astonished at the
boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read
boris listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his
boris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinski
boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that
boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not
boris made a grimace
boris made up his mind to avoid meeting natasha but despite that
boris no she shut her eyesno theres nothing at all
boris or between you two its all nonsense
boris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a
boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a
boris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha the plump
boris received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for
boris remembered natasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining
boris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady
boris said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to
boris said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without
boris she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the
boris smiled
boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother
boris smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to
boris smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical or
boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was
boris too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhensk
boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased
boris understood that this was meant for him and closing his
boris uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were
boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two
boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher
boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army
boris was to travel to join the army and about whom natasha had
boris who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been
boris with a smile
boris with severity i am glad are you here on leave he went on
boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have
borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him

borodino and on their left flank uvarovs cavalry had put the

borodino because napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a
borodino below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge
borodino for all the generals who came to moscow after that battle
borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit
borodino not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition
borodino or austerlitz takes place as those who planned it
borodino the direct consequence of the battle of borodino was
borodino the one where the battle was fought far from being strong
borodino the other corrected him
borodino they did not stop at any one of these positions because
borodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that

comforting her
comforting himself with this same idea this idea is le bien public
comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction
comic but extremely attractive
comical childish painstaking effect that had been in it before

coming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give

coming friend
coming he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you
coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question
coming out into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the
coming out of kutuzovs room into the waiting room with the papers
coming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovnitsyn frowned
coming out onto a field under the enemys fire this brave general
coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising
coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the

coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a
coming to attack him and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a
coming to take him from me and he laughed shut his eyes and clung
coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first
coming up
coming up just then i sent to ask for news and hear that she is a
command and bagration being in command of the second army tried to
command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our
command and power in their primary form the man who worked most
command himself takes part in
command in a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers
command it
command of a regiment of chasseurs though he did not want to remind
command of an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i
command of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to
command of the advanced army prince andrew bolkonski came into the
command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferior
command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the

command petya went on what would it be to you oh you want a
command the one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at
command the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so
command was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and
command was to blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and
commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered

commander among them hm
commander and hungry and weary making his way past the baggage
commander and the question arose whether the troops were to be in
commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers
commander but now from lack of officers a battalion commander
commander dressed up in feathers and gold
commander in chief

commander in chief does not all resemble the activity we imagine to
commander in chief from among such a mass of troops
commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and
commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish
commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at
commander in chief it was evident that he performed his duty as a
commander in chief kutiizovs adjutant whispered to prince andrew
commander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived general
commander in chief of the recruiting granted by the emperor if i had
commander in chief there resulted on the one hand indecision and
commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on

commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting
commander in chief would be though the aidedecamp did not know
commander in chiefs actions describe to us for instance the
commander in chiefs discretion to take measures or not for the
commander in chiefs name to rectify this omission prince andrew
commander in chiefs office were gathered kutuzov himself
commander in chiefs orderly speaks to officers replied
commander in chiefs room
commander in which inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence
commander just as he had done after austerlitz he related this
commander like children in an embarrassing situation and the
commander of genius gave it losing a quarter of his army and

commanders of columns by evening the adjutants had spread it to
commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much
commanders stirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a
commanders were much exasperated with one another and long after
commanding a large guerrilla detachment from the time he received his
commanding officer but in reply to the third question which he did
commanding officer to hand in a complaint about it
commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in
commanding officers and the orders he gave them and to his
commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters the little old
commands
commands an officer still less often acts directly himself but
commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case
commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the
commencement of a war and rostov conscious of his advantageous
commencement of his reign being the savior of russia
commencement of the interview
commendation from his commanders during his absence he had been
commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to
commiserating tone
commiseration and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all

everything at any rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two
everything became strange confused and misty in pierres eyes
everything before you everything and you
everything but what an account of everything might be nicholas knew
everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait
everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy

everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions
everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled if
everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really

everything in it would be stolen
everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely
everything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to their
everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his
everything in the world prince andrew came up to her with downcast
everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and
everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and
everything is green already how early the birches and cherry
everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break
everything may be over for me all these memories will be no more
everything military and alien to himself and had returned to his

he addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself
he again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergey
he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down but looked at
he again paused in indecision
he again started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one
he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted
he alone with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy

he always tried to stifle one about which he always deceived himself

he asked whose company but he really meant are you
he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with
he ate nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly
he attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the
he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general
he began pacing the room the screaming ceased and a few more
he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone
he believe had he repented of his unbelief was he now there there
he bending down a finger
he bent his head and was silent for some time
he blinked went red got up and sat down again struggling with

he but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times
he called karabakh though it was of ukranian breed and went up to
he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the
he called the most important generals to him
he came out of the governors room involuntarily listening now to the
he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him
he came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously
he cannot endure the notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal
he cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his
he caught helenes left hand and turned her the only sound audible
he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her
he checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes
he chose at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to
he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna prince
he closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance
he closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of
he closed his eyes and remained silent a long time then as if in
he closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his
he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of
he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every
he considered them
he continually hurt princess marys feelings and tormented her
he continually realized as he read that book the joy hitherto
he continued to pace the room looking gloomily at denisov and the
he continued to shout
he continued to struggle desperately forward and from between the
he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the
he could find no satisfactory position he kept closing his eyes and
he could give no opinion on such an important government order and
he could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and ragged
he could hear that lavrushka that sly bold orderly of denisovs was
he could let him have till may and asked him to be more economical
he could not break away from her and that though it would be a
he could not did not wish to believe that
he could not do that the people only gave him power that he
he could not finish and ran out of the room
he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her
he could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to
he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions
he could not marry for he was married already said pierre
he could not marry he is married
he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha
he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel
he could not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind
he could not spare at such an important moment to return to him when
he could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the
he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one
he crossed himself with an accustomed movement bent till he touched
he decided that he must attend to his sons education by finding a
he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it
he described not only her look but her exclamations and the brief
he described the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensure and
he did frighten me youve seen the princess is it true shes in
he did he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only
he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to
he did not and never will know it and now it will never never be
he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a
he did not begin the engagement
he did not draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from her she
he did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the
he did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before
he did not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he
he did not explain to himself what these new relations were
he did not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had
he did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance
he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left
he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile
he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he
he did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air
he did not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the
he did not finish what he wished to say
he did not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he
he did not know that the brick buildings built to plan were being
he did not know what to say
he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did
he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the
he did not reply
he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the
he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who
he did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth
he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been
he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth
he did replied shinshin he was in the caucasus and ran away
he did so i have saved your life and i save your honor having
he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there
he discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward but he
he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natasha
he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the
he divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first
he does not and cannot believe this
he does not look like a common man said the interpreter after
he doesnt obey i said it twice and he doesnt obey she is
he doesnt play that part right said uncle suddenly with an
he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards
he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but
he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye
he drew her aside
he drew the logs together
he drew up his chair and continued to explain
he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her natasha did not
he drove to the karagins with the firm intention of proposing
he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natasha was
he dwelt particularly on the word possible as pooossible he
he embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder
he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with
he embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for
he emitted a longdrawn groan and then again became silent morel
he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head
he entered the dining room the whole company were standing
he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing
he even felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly tongues of flame
he even found cause for selfsatisfaction in having so successfully
he exists but to understand him is hard the mason began again
he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the
he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
he feared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair which was
he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan which aroused
he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously
he felt afraid afraid not for his life but for the courage he needed
he felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his
he felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked
he felt rather than what he thought
he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and
he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass
he felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if
he felt that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that
he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far
he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had
he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was
he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former
he filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at
he fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for
he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with
he flung it on the ground
he for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before
he found old friends and associations besides the comforts of life of
he found the prussian army boris speaking with deliberation told
he frowning angrily and turning away from pierre
he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled
he gave me no instructions i think i could he returned
he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that
he gave to princess mary
he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability
he glanced at her with timid surprise
he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were
he glanced at prince andrews face and quickly turned away
he going to the door and looking into the nursery
he good i didnt know him and how he dances dear me theres a
he got into bed all kept awake a long time that night
he got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened
he grew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always
he grew used to this demand knowing that natasha asked nothing for
he had a right to suppose so and in fact the last letter he had
he had accounted them his mind had penetrated to those distances
he had all he wanted the thought of his wife which had been a
he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps
he had an inkpot and sat down to write
he had an officers sword in his hand the soldier was pale his
he had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my
he had aroused in himself
he had attached such importance and was surprised that this event
he had become three times as rich as before
he had been able to retain the old princes favor for twenty years had
he had been doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he
he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with
he had been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more
he had been rehearsing and began telling him how he had already
he had been so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign
he had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day
he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he
he had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after
he had caught a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely she
he had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his
he had come because moscow the capital was no more and only the army
he had come over because he had been slighted in the service that
he had conferred on them to build a new chantry to the church at
he had dealt him
he had desired and expected turning to his adjutant he ordered him to
he had done in petersburg at anna scherers reception
he had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to
he had ears which though there was a piece of tow in one of them
he had expected he only heard dolokhovs hurried steps and his
he had felt continually all his life was now near to him and by
he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top
he had found so difficult to utter i love you it all comes from
he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostov gave rein to his
he had gone out for provisions
he had gone taking his wife with him and had settled down with her
he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had
he had had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of
he had heard of kuragins abduction of rostova which was talked of
he had heard that kutuzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing
he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of
he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre
he had just heard particulars of that mornings sitting of the council
he had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife
he had left his purchases
he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes
he had left the countess apartments he was sitting upstairs in a
he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests
he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done
he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which
he had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious
he had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties
he had no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your
he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or
he had no time to realize who these men were he saw the senior
he had none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others
he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of
he had not done since childhood
he had not finished the last verse before the young people began
he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
he had not yet quite yielded went to inquire how he could arrange for
he had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone
he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she too
he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an
he had rarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he
he had read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly
he had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away
he had received and given the orders for next days battle and had
he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong
he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he
he had said but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a
he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon
he had seen the body of petya rostov that same day he had learned
he had seen the emperor but there was no one beyond the ditch now
he had so often heard from his fellow hussars
he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre
he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the
he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said
he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
he had the letter taken from his pocket and the table on which
he had thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her
he had till now gazed over mens heads and gladly regarded the
he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command
he had to offer he himself carefully scanned each face appraising
he had witnessed on the battlefield the heaviness of his head and
he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the
he halted prince andrew was behind among the immense number
he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot
he happened to be directly facing natasha and was struck by a curious
he has a heart of gold
he has been set down he died replied someone
he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third
he has betrayed his tsar and his country he had gone over to
he has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the
he has gone to peters but i dont know said pierre

he has perspired said prince andrew
he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and
he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated
he has weported himself sick hes to be stwuck off the list
he hated her and was forever sundered from her despite denisovs
he heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers
he heard the sound of a scuffle and sonyas disapproving voice
he held sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and
he hes crazy he did not want to listen but whats the use
he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the
he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket
he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least
he himself undertook his daughters education and to develop these
he himself went to the nursery
he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
he imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was
he imagined that the war with russia came about by his will and the
he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by
he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on
he indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw a footman
he intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he said
he intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take natasha and
he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his
he involuntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of
he is a bully thought pierre to kill a man means nothing to him
he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to
he is a little better today said he i was looking for you
he is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him
he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not
he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another
he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered
he is all the rage just now
he is alone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he
he is always cheerful satisfied and serene what wouldnt i give
he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others
he is better than any of you exclaimed natasha getting up if
he is charming he has no sex

he is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of the
he is dying and you come and bleed him and patch him up he will drag
he is getting married and also from my husbands friend bolkonski
he is good and kind and i am fond of him he thought of dessalles
he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped
he is just the same as ever replied anna mikhaylovna
he is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had
he is like
he is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need not
he is my refuge his will be done he exclaimed
he is my uncle your sewene highness
he is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from
he is no more
he is not here and will never return he is not here for whom then is
he is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the
he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of men
he is poor now and i am rich yes thats the only reason
he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes
he is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and
he is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace that is
he is sensible well educated and goodnatured and the next hes a
he is so ill we women prince and she smiled tenderly always know
he is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speak
he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i
he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya
he jumped down and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his
he jumped up at the sound of her light step
he kept awake kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm for which
he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but
he kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their wont
he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it
he knew no more than the others what his words meant during his
he knew no one and despite his smart guardsmans uniform all these
he knew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
he knew prince andrews former atheistic convictions
he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will
he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing
he knew very well that this was napoleon but napoleons presence
he knew well both the appeal to the people and the news from the
he know that he is a man just a man while i i am something
he knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre
he knows of course what this loss means to me he cant want my
he laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had
he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips
he laughed till tears started to his eyes
he laughing at us old fellows
he lay down on a sofa without undressing and was awakened soon
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his big
he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief
he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and
he learned that kutuzovs staff were not far off in the village the
he left in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefs
he left it to russians to make an idol of this useless old man but
he left long ago she has been at deaths door
he left off visiting helene and received reproachful notes from her
he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood
he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles
he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a
he liked her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling
he liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible
he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices
he listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how
he listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that
he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at
he looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face
he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze
he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned
he looked at her attentively
he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a
he looked at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not
he looked at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatych
he looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with
he looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and
he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently
he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the
he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of
he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor
he loses
he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this took her hand and
he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away
he made himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the
he mentioned him on the day of prince vasilis arrival prince
he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend
he might marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father
he might not only might but should have gone up to the
he moaned piteously and exchanging looks they set him down again
he mounted and rode toward semenovsk
he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was
he moved his hand over her hair
he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous
he must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers
he must keep order keep the law thats what the government is
he must not yield to that feeling because to marry her a girl almost
he mustered his remaining strength he raised his pistol and aimed
he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event
he never considered personal danger
he never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a
he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at
he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they neednt trouble
he nodded in answer to balashavs low and respectful bow and coming
he not been hindered by anything on the way his intention could not
he not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried
he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used
he noticed everything
he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the
he now heard distinctly
he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and
he often spoke about him and about his love for him letting it be
he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung
he opened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode
he ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on
he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it
he ought long ago to have been made an officer that he was braver
he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he
he paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes
he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and
he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of
he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her
he paused a little while
he paused and just as he was about to say something more another
he paused and looked around
he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands
he paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself
he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and
he paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa
he paused looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said
he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being
he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed
he possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions
he pressed her hand
he pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle
he pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes
he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there
he put his other foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in
he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again
he put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter my
he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes and
he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the
he quickly entered the small reception room with its
he quite understood them and shared their opinion but for that very
he raised his arm and addressed the people almost shouting
he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home
he recalled petyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise
he received him teteatate at his own house and talked to him long
he received in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the
he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great
he regretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to
he remained silent awhile
he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection
he remembered that he would have to die he said to himself well
he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing
he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his
he repeated several times then paused drew from his pocket a gold
he replied that he could not answer it
he reproached himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this
he returned and trying to appear calm added and dont imagine i have
he returned from sokolniki after the duel and had spent that first
he rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and
he rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answering
he rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went
he run into the redoubt before a thin sallowfaced perspiring man in
he said
he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the
he said exchanging glances with his young companion anyhow his
he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
he said now his future depended whether he would follow the same
he said perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a
he said something more but rostov did not wait to hear it and
he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long
he said they want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of
he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the
he said to me the chief duty of a true mason as i have told you
he said to one of his adjutants and then turned to the duke of
he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began
he sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands
he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading
he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and
he saw in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming
he saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had
he saw rather short man having evidently come from the light into the
he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the
he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
he says a woman and mary nikolievna is a lady remarked a house
he says did that deed and i put the knife under your head while you
he says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he
he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not
he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it
he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and
he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently
he seem
he seemed a man from another world and for a long time natasha
he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and
he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished
he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of bees they
he sees well enough he added and what i am so pleased about
he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it
he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are
he set to work
he shall i serve them up
he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
he shook his fists at her and screamed
he should disapprove of andrews choice but in reply he said what
he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is
he should endure toils and dangers during these wanderings pierre
he should pay folks off properly a thin workingman with frowning
he shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of the
he showed an interest in trifles joked about de beaussets love
he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut
he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted boris down one flight
he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to
he shrugged his shoulders when pierre was mentioned and pointing to
he sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at
he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french
he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than
he smiled and held out his hand to her
he sobbed kuzmich tears and from all sides was smothered in
he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the
he soon forgot it
he spent the night in our house and is going with us
he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his
he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov
he spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be
he still had all the letters in his hand opening them
he stood at the back and though he had heard hardly anything
he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd
he stopped and remained silent for a long time
he stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been
he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply
he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised his head and
he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rostov let go
he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i
he suddenly made friends with him but in 1811 they again quarreled
he sung a second a third below the high note ah god how fine did
he take bribes thats the way he was brought up and everybody does
he talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when
he thats a tradesman that is to say hes the restaurant keeper
he the lover assumed the role of the husband as well as several
he the old prince himself would die before then and he decided to
he this expression evidently pleased him
he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he
he thought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized
he thought it would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live

he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he
he was awaiting prince andrews return with dread and went every day
he was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him

he was left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the

he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which
he was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found
he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his
he was thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their love
he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did
he was told that he had gone to a ball at general kikins and that
he was told that the prince had gone to the nursery

he was with everyone in the regiment and how satisfied his father was

he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and
he was writing ill do it

he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled
he wont have those splendid provinces yet he might have united

her a grateful look but was still expectant and looking for
her about so
her aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the
her album making him write in it did not allow him to allude to
her all day natasha what have i done to deserve it
her already awake she was afraid of being late for matins hastily
her always found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking
her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a
her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had
her and assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was
her and at last succeeded in making them believe her her first
her and during his stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to
her and her alone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine
her and kissed only her hand after their engagement quite
her and she with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats
her and so on and these pictures of the future had given him
her and then after i met her under such circumstances so strangely
her and to her fathers memory assuming that she did go down to see
her at all she looked at him and did not think but felt about
her away compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of
her away go away all of you its not true killed ha ha
her away quickly that very night if possible with a womans
her baby herself a thing then unheard of and considered injurious
her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess
her beautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it
her beautiful radiant eyes it was as if joy a supreme joy apart
her beauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george
her beauty occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his
her best before and behind them other visitors were entering also
her betrayal of him and all his own simple relations with her
her black arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand
her bodice with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little
her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince
her both marya dmitrievna and sonya were amazed when they saw how
her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody old count
her bouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the
her brother a small oval antique darkfaced icon of the saviour
her brother as living and was always awaiting news of his return
her brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer
her brother often wondered as he looked at her she did not seem
her brother petya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on
her brother shook his head incredulously
her brothers arm led him into the sitting room where they began
her brows this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more he
her but i dont know how to put it without you or when something
her but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it and
her cap and velvet gown
her cheeks sunken
her childish promises and accept the offer but before he had time to
her children she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned
her christ he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her as a mother
her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her fathers illness
her companions not having the least conception that it could be
her completely the count was not angry even when they told him that
her condition and immediately after that informed them that she had
her confess everything and intercepting the note to natasha she
her cousin evidently wishing to distract her mind
her daughter in marriage to her lover even now agitated the
her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered
her departure next morning she went to her room and remained alone
her diplomatic tact
her do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room
her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound
her drawing room with her habitual skill the large group in which
her eager face and shining eyes galloped up to them she was followed
her eight miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our
her embroidery frame and as usual began to tell her what he had
her enemies and people who hated her in order to pray for them she
her every day until then but he could no longer do it he could
her every joy besides she had lost all the old interests of her
her eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit
her eyes filling with tears and then not for the first time the
her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit
her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and moving her lips as if to
her eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look
her eyes grew dim by the expression of her fathers face not sad
her eyes inquiringly on him
her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this
her eyes were smiling expectantly her downy lip rose and remained
her eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasili read
her face
her face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find
her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which
her face became sad
her face close to her mothers i am sorry forgive me ill never do
her face here i am i am she now do you understand uncle her
her face resumed its former cold artificial expression she
her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she
her face to be forgotten
her face today she cried as she said goodby to uncle sonya
her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression
her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes
her face would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible
her fat finger
her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had
her fate would be decided that day but that they also knew what she
her father
her father
her father and when the old prince was at home went to his study with
her father had forgotten his sons letter on the drawingroom table
her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he
her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and
her father or at natasha
her father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps
her fathers words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of
her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and
her first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come to
her first impulse to run out to her and remained in her hiding place
her firstborn more than all her other children and even reproached
her for a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was
her for a long time while conversing with pierre natasha heard a
her for jesuit institutions as to which she received indications
her for the sake of doing right then let union with her have only a
her for whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her
her forehead and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt
her forehead his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and
her forgiveness without knowing what for from that day the eldest
her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely i am not
her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel as she called
her hair got up and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the
her hand he left the room with quick resolute strides without
her handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful
her hands the countess was to wear a claretcolored velvet dress and
her he said
her he was still lying on the bed as before but the stern expression
her head and began to speak rapidly
her head covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some
her head the pains had just left her strands of her black hair
her head toward the darkness of the open doorway
her her life had no external aims only a need to exercise her
her how did it begin when did it all come about and here he was
her husband and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was
her husband had gone with others to the cathedral whence they were
her husband himself who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing
her husband it was not what he was saying that pleased her that
her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone
her husband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did
her husbands life she had demands on her time which could be
her husbands portrait on it
her i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice
her i know its impossible to speak of it now but i want to be a
her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed
her illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted
her improvised ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked
her in one clear and simple law the law of love and selfsacrifice
her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned
her knees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and
her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging
her know
her lap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the
her legs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion
her life ventured to disobey him she refused to go away and her
her lip descended she brought her face close to her sisterinlaws
her lips to his cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force
her look of shame on his breast
her lovely head like a coronet entered the room calm and majestic
her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy
her made her shudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and
her mademoiselle bourienne with whom she had never been able to be
her maid who was evidently looking for her and who stopped
her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress but all the
her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something
her master and yet regretful of her cloak
her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the
her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that became
her mind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box
her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so
her mistress entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a
her most intimate friend from childhood that same julie karagina
her mother quite excited
her mother saw her agitation and understood why her husband did
her mothers door princess mary pale and with quivering chin came
her mothers room his face was puckered up and wet with tears he had
her mothers side passed through the crowd behind a liveried
her mothers words suddenly interrupted her
her mouth to the other with her tongue
her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing
her naked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself
her natasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid
her neck and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was
her nephew and playing with him
her nephews education for which she had always felt herself
her new guest poor girl shes devilish ugly thought anatole
her niece passed sonya wont you write to nicholas she spoke in a
her niece princess bolkonskaya she is here in voronezh with her
her no he is no more he is not but here where he was is something
her not at all bad that little companion i hope she will bring her
her other children the nearer the time came for petya to return
her over his spectacles
her own eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and
her own eyes the look they had when she was not thinking of
her own grief
her own happiness
her own injustice toward her
her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her
her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red master what have you
her parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her
her parish church the church of the assumption built over the
her pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall
her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the
her personal affairs cheered sonya
her please dont it is too painful for her
her powers appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one
her prince andrew recognized her without looking and held out his
her prompt departure princess mary listened without understanding
her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning
her put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de
her quietly and went to the door sonya went away by another door
her reported in their own way the rumors current among the people of
her room hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her
her room vainly trying to master her agitation
her rudenesses and told good stories about her while none the less
her said the old count
her said the old prince angrily what an idea im ready for it
her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at
her seat
her she had worn him out had caused his quarrel with his son had
her she is an angelic being ah boris boris she paused and how
her she lifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said
her she ran across the street turned down a side street to the left
her she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and
her she told her how he had complimented her how he told her he
her shoulders and struck an attitude
her shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his
her sigh seemed to say yes theres nothing left for you and me
her sister dropped the portfolio anna mikhaylovna stooping
her sisterinlaws dress
her sitting room from which those who were there immediately withdrew
her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and
her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn

him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him
him by the bearer of the letter
him comforting but they were only thoughts something was lacking

him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting
him like a child her smile for him was the same as for everybody but

him not letting anyone read them at dinner

him off his feet and hammered him with his fists shouts of approval
him olga go and see whether uncles beef tea is ready it is
him on all sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all
him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles
him only lifes customary routine to such customary routine
him opened them out closed them finally pushed them away and
him or anyone else and i dont want anything of the kind
him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say and not
him otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he
him out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him spite
him pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though
him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the
him pointing at rostov who noticed that the old man wanted to
him princess mary and julie karagina
him princess mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she
him remember this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt
him reported the cause of this indisposition was the strong
him returned to his place and sat down in his hands he had something

him said the valet
him said the wit shinshin parodying the words of voltaire
him seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a
him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her
him she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look
him she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible
him she led him to the house offered him lunch and sat down with
him she looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to
him she seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he
him she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of
him since he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the
him since yesterday she must be told then at least she wont go on
him so when i see him
him something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german
him something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice
him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and
him spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired
him stepan stepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether
him stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf
him suffer because of me so he confessed and it was all written down
him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments
him talk but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles
him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon did
him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little
him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition
him that he was quite different and distinct from those other
him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made
him that they must go to see his highness
him thats a thing i hate everything is possible
him the baby prince nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse
him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had
him the exercise book containing geometrical figures
him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and
him the mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror
him the milks come but im sorry to leave you
him the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with
him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron rode at full
him the way she cried to the maid angrily opening her mouth and
him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach
him then excusing herself she went to the door of the old
him there was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the
him they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary
him they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of
him this morning
him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only
him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as
him to be the exminister stein was there because his advice was
him to begin anything anew but that he must live out his life
him to come there were other guests and the countess talked little to
him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were
him to have expected anything from speranski and from any of his own
him to her husband who she imagined was jealous of prince andrews
him to his house in petersburg and now she has come here and
him to his present state
him to jest
him to kiss his white hands graciously conversed with tutolmin then
him to repeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a
him to see her majesty the archduchess also wished to see him he did
him to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did
him to stop the lunatics solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow
him to take part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why he had
him to the devil im busy he shouted to lavrushka who went up to
him to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from
him to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the
him to whom did you apply
him too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart
him transient as they were have been one of the sweetest comforts to
him tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the
him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin everyone
him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually
him up
him very much
him was a clear blue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a
him was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it
him was being done and he fell back into that artificial realm of
him was drawing near
him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the
him was that he slept very little and instead of sleeping in his
him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft the two borzois
him we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon
him what are prince vasili and that son of his to me prince
him when he opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his
him when he went to dinner
him when light impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard
him when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the
him where a wolf might come out having straightened his coat and
him which promised him happiness and those thoughts though now vague
him who gave it you and the point is that we knew whom he had it
him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to go
him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange
him with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the
him with curiosity
him with glittering eyes
him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose
him with nearly their former strength for denisov too the
him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior
him with tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed him
him with the others again someone shouted stretchers four men
him with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude
him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned

himself a tiny obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince
himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love
himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset
himself an enemy or a deceitful german whom he would not only kill
himself and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he
himself and he pointed to lavrushka
himself and his family military administrative political and
himself and insult alexander just what he had least desired at the
himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be
himself and natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he
himself and not become vehement but almost always did become
himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself
himself and was leading him from the room
himself and which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and
himself as a living being by the fact that he wills that is is
himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden
himself as theodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore
himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to
himself at that moment he did not desire moscow or victory or glory
himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors
himself before the icon all the others did the same then the count
himself but i cant coerce my feelings if i love sonya that
himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an
himself but the best man in the world and free he would ask on his
himself but was adored by everybody no thats impossible said
himself but without his musket groaning aloud and swinging his arm
himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when
himself come in come in he added to the princess
himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would
himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss pierre said to
himself entering the french service the captain was happy the
himself entirely to his laughter and after such a laugh she always
himself fall into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not

himself he got up from his chair and went to the door
himself he rose from the table one does get tired sitting so
himself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those
himself i dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about
himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he
himself in bolkonski
himself in solitude on his island justifying his actions by intrigues
himself in the midst of his army it was clear that there was
himself in this way the study door opened and on the threshold
himself inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really
himself knew that provisions were scarce there but because this
himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his
himself know what to do and this irresolution communicated itself
himself knowing why or whither
himself mentally to this new position of affairs
himself nicholas arrived at the governors rather late but with
himself nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got
himself not a word about some denisov or other though he
himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were
himself of but had also convinced the sovereign emperors of
himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss the
himself once or twice within a twelvemonth and then he would go and

his absence but it was so terrible for him to think that anything
his absentmindedness some of which had even been invented about him
his actions
his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
his adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutuzov was
his admiration for his wife
his adventure at bogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for
his advice about petyas education or nicholas service the old
his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table
his affairs which called for some decisive action their town house
his aidesdecamp at bennigsens country house
his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his brothersinlaw

his arm above the elbow as from the shock to his horse and from
his arm really did appear
his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling
his arms he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the
his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest
his army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a
his attention
his audience over his spectacles and continued

his bald head he looked goodnaturedly at the officer and the
his bay gelding sitting at home in winter and lying in his overgrown
his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and
his bed and seating himself comfortably clasped his arms round
his being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant
his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince
his benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner
his betrothed had broken faith with him which he felt the more
his blunders at krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian
his bony fingers what is the difficulty nonsense childishness
his boots you can see everything from there lets go there prince

his breast and said let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to
his breast as was his custom when at home taking leave of a
his breath and running so lightly frightened rostov he seized his
his breeches a new pair of handsome silkembroidered braces that
his bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted
his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the
his brotherinlaw nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from
his brows prince theodore and all those to encourage culture and
his bulk with evident ease
his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle
his buttoned coat and handed him two letters
his caleche to be sent for kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a
his campstool his sallow face swollen and heavy his eyes dim his
his capers reminded him of dancing and looking at the childs round
his chair and began deliberately with a smile
his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by tikhon who
his chest his tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the
his clear insolent eyes in the generals face
his clear perception of death there they are those rudely painted
his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and
his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to
his companion and said something pointing to his mouth the
his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained
his company if you were cleverer and more agreeable i should
his comrades
his comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided
his comrades with mud

his cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern
his daughter
his daughter and give her to a husband the prince never directly
his daughter placed chintzcovered down cushions for him to sit on
his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly
his daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears
his daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking
his daughter to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk
his death dearest she repeated and began sobbing with tears
his debts amounted to or what dowry he could give vera when his
his deception he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the
his departure for the army to be in anna pavlovnas drawing room he
his departure from that city while walking through the streets with
his design excited him still more
his desk busy with his will i expect one of the princes favorite
his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness
his diminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according
his dinner and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a
his dinner balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned
his dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he
his disdain for the comforts of life his absentmindedness and
his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the
his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death he alone
his division to the decisive point and gains the victory alone
his dominion and guards are given to him and millions of money are
his dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he was
his dron on the day of the princes funeral and told him to have
his due i always wonder at the way rumors fly from petersburg to
his ear
his ears tingle
his education his early liberalism the advisers who surrounded
his efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and
his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears
his elbow in a brokendown shed in the village of knyazkovo at the
his elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible
his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old
his emotion
his enemy
his energy to influence alexander and pfuels whole plan was
his every action depends on his organization his character and the
his every word and movement was described with ecstasy
his exactions and that the pupils parents wept at having to let
his excellency have the courier horses it was plain that he was lying
his excellency is staying in the same house with them
his excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the
his eye again and let his head sink still lower
his eye but rostopchin did not look at him a vein in the young mans
his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something some
his eyes and dozed off alpatych made a slight movement
his eyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a
his eyes and thought he would never never them again suddenly he
his eyes as became known later he had scarcely begun to address
his eyes but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and
his eyes can they be french he looked at the approaching
his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that
his eyes he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the
his eyes off the french
his eyes significantly
his eyes still smiling glittered with effort and exasperation as
his eyes that he may not see or understand him and may not see or
his eyes upon her later on she recalled how she had asked her
his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as
his face
his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression but the
his face against his will pierre stood with his arms hanging down and
his face and all those at court far from coldshouldering him as
his face and eyes
his face and just nodded to him with to him with his long head but
his face as soon as prince andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent
his face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him
his face besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday
his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of
his face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess mary
his face grew more and more animated only when a man was killed or
his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing
his face in the mirror
his face probably looked very terrible for the officer said something
his face shone with selfsatisfaction and pleasure
his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his
his face under his gray mustaches especially as the song grew brisker
his familiar business and like a wellfed but not overfat horse that
his family
his family and to the city entrusted to him and of himself not
his family away was alone at bald hills and was sitting indoors
his father and even his comfortable bed in the house on the
his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for
his father by spoiling his own career and he laughed at
his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to
his father had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his
his father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life
his father now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an
his father received his sons communication with external composure
his father to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady who
his father was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct
his favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred
his fear and grief at being left alone
his feelings and it seemed plain to her that those words which had
his feelings for the emperor not everyone could understand and with
his feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev
his feet off the sofa
his feet toward the fire
his feet were bare the other whose appearance particularly struck
his felt coat stretched his legs and set his cap straight the
his final conclusions in the form of commands having listened to a
his firm and virile features gave him a rather comical expression
his first examination yet to disclose his rank and position was
his fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while
his footing and related quietly and humorously how he had know that
his forehead remarked
his former affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man
his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped
his frequent fits of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out
his friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of
his friend in amazement
his friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he
his full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic
his full height without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with
his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief his
his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom
his generals and while awaiting the emperors arrival led a
his gentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still
his gestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the
his glance he spoke a few words to some of the generals and
his glass flung it on the floor
his godson you know he is borys godfather and allow him something
his grandeur for his great exploits there are all told us by
his grandfather who was his godfather trembling and afraid of
his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by
his great physical sufferings joseph alexeevich is never weary of
his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early
his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note
his hair cropped something hidden and unknown to herself but
his hair he began to pace the room
his hair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of limetree
his halfclosed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words
his hand
his hand
his hand a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops
his hand and drawing him down put her arm round his thin scraggy
his hand and kissed it
his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general
his hand lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and
his hand opened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a
his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his
his hand sometimes touching his horses side with his foot or
his hands and remained so for some minutes piteous helpless
his hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer
his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing
his hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood
his hands were folded she concluded convincing herself that the
his hands with a passionate movement
his handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling tenderness
his hat and stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and
his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning
his head and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after
his head and the french shall too believe me he went on
his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound
his head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his
his head over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a
his head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair
his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him
his head with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the
his headquarters had that day been transferred
his health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had
his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he
his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he
his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general
his heels held his hands to the blaze and turned away his face
his heels we know what that means
his helmet and horse guards jacket shouting something to a pale
his hero and commander was following quite a different train of
his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling
his horse but from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why
his horse galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell
his horse gave the word of command and immediately hearing behind
his horse keep pace with the company
his horse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at
his horse with his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the
his horses hoofs
his house a small but select company and why this would give him
his house and had so often laughed at him now said with a common
his house recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasili and
his hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the
his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natasha
his impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he
his infinity and all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts
his influence but in princess drubetskayas case he felt after her
his instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence
his intention to elope with a blonde lady
his invitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on
his jaw quivering hes been dead since morning after all were men
his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his
his knee with the palm of his hand
his knock
his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that
his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she
his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both
his lathe and as usual did not look round at her
his leg perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the
his lessons teaching him russian and music herself and talking to
his life man recognizes and can but recognize as free
his life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations
his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the latter was
his light feet marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight
his line and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the
his lips having now prepared a wellphrased reply sire i left
his lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and
his little feet in low shoes iogel flew first across the hall with
his looks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and
his lower jaw but you have used such words to me mean and so
his magnanimity and having written a letter to the emperor
his majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the
his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the
his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our
his malodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeks
his manhood he went to balls and into ladies society with an
his manners with the strict formality of his house at that moment the
his manuscript his remarks as he termed it which was to be
his marshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the
his marshals or such plans to the russian commanders all the facts
his master would touch and delude him
his masters thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince
his men and officers in the regiment they called him our prince
his mental edifices no longer existed for him to that question
his might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout
his mind in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either
his mind recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had
his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of
his mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted
his mistake at once now is it suitable that count kutuzov the
his mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as
his moments of cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and
his moscow house and the country house on his moscow estate which had
his most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of
his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
his mouth and winking at the count
his movements and with an idiotic expression of face he wore a
his movements were still slow and measured
his muscular brown back
his naivete
his name his nationality would also be given in the answer so he
his napkin and went himself
his neck as if he intended to say something but immediately with
his neck on his right sat the italian abbe whom pierre had met at
his nephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the princes and of
his new role
his noble soul peacefully to leave this
his old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was not for
his opinions but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to
his order for a battle next day immediately became known from one end
his outstretched hand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading
his own about the facts he was recounting for some time he
his own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen
his own eyes his eyes kept closing and in his fancy appeared now
his own grief decided that he must ride there
his own he now replied to princess mary so that nothing definite
his own heart from vice and indulgently to smooth with it the heart
his own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the
his own impotence was gained by the russians at borodino the french
his own legs occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut
his own pity
his own place as he had felt under the parental roof but here was
his own regiment but the whole brigade gave rostov a dinner to which
his own thoughts his broad head with its bold features and glittering
his own way a queer lot
his own weight and turning to look at the hussars starting in the
his own will the inevitable course of events and he can see them and
his own would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who
his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled
his part is not yet ended the man who ten years before and a year
his participation in that action
his passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but
his persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling
his person honor was shown to a simple fighting russian soldier
his personality
his physical strength and agility during the first days of his
his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled
his pipe now for the first time recognized the old natasha a flood
his place and bring him water
his plans for his future were completely altered he was not rich
his plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he
his pocketbook
his position he smiled ironically but even if he also took up
his position was fully assured he had not only become known but
his position were he could not have believed it had he not at one
his powder and paint he will not be wanted any more
his power
his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses
his powers he was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was
his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing
his presence he looked straight at his adjutants face without
his presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and
his presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits
his previous resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his
his private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers
his project of army reform which had been accepted for
his proposal and sonyas refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought
his pseudoorders during the battle were also no worse than
his purpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinners
his quarters at mikhaylovna on the smolensk road
his reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a
his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment
his reins settled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was
his retreat fled in the opposite direction
his riding whip
his righteousness and let it preserve us thy chosen israel bless
his rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me
his role so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on
his room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the
his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were
his rs and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent
his saber only ten paces divided them dolokhov lowered his head to
his saber which had caught in his cloak it was an oldfashioned saber
his saddle horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged
his safety though from prince andrews letter it was evident that
his satellites the senior clerk a countinghouse clerk a scullery
his schon grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a
his seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times
his senior officer bagration
his serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join
his serene highness he knew kutuzovs attention would be caught by
his serene highness would not have it or someone persuaded him
his serfs
his servant
his servant handed him a halfcut novel in the form of letters
his servant heah bwing me my pipe it was indicative of
his servants too terenty and vaska in their own way noticed the
his shoulders
his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something
his shoulders and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture
his shoulders only once after the affair of the berezina did he get
his shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot
his shoulders women my dear fellow women
his shriveled head and in a corner of the room sat a chanter
his side had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to
his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before
his silence pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that
his sinewy hairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned
his sister and natasha
his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence
his sister natasha gave him a wink and neither refrained long
his skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your
his slightest inattention she trembled became flustered and heated
his small husky but true voice some verses called enchantress
his smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiled
his sofa and did not cry any more but prayed continually turning in
his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to
his son
his son had been killed he tried not to change his former way of
his son happy princess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time
his son however he employed the diplomacy he reserved for
his son only smiled
his son sat at the table writing he glanced round
his sons portrait grew still louder napoleon frowned
his soul but no more shots came
his soul now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future
his soul now he remembered denisov with his changed expression his
his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there
his staff anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had hoped to find
his stand and theres zakhar himself and still the same horse and
his stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted
his steady tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling
his steps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you
his stern eyes on his son
his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to
his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his
his sufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has
his suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they
his suite to compare his impressions with those of others they
his suite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the
his taking part in any action whatever of denisovs that was why
his talk he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry
his talk while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped
his tea handkerchief and pipe
his teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind
his temper i shall answer for it and not you and youd better not
his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning
his tent on the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive
his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so he
his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in
his thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which
his thought but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding
his throat when the door opened and lavrushka came in with some
his ticket he again began crying piteously and kissing me one can do
his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but
his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending
his toes pressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his
his toes toward the general the captains face showed the
his tone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look
his too again pressed pierres hand and leaned his elbows on the
his track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the
his troops were the same his generals the same the same
his two sons and saying i will perish with them but we will not be
his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the
his usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the
his usual stake of twenty rubles
his vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian
his verses bowed to bagration everyone rose feeling that dinner was
his very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to
his view to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the
his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might derive
his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home and then went
his voice were at once heard from there
his waist the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped
his was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence
his way being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the
his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal
his way he prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with
his way to him
his weak figure number two he squeaked fire medvedev
his weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and
his white hat and green tail coat
his whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed he put on
his whole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field
his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed
his whole manner of life all his relations with old friends all
his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in moscow for the
his wife
his wife how she would love him become quite different and how all
his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things
his wife some italians called out to him viva il re he turned to
his wife whispered in french
his wife with a pensive smile and said poor fellows they dont know
his wifes line of thought
his will and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all his
his will and his will is governed only by infinite love for us and
his will he is as right as other historians who look for the
his will might have saved russia and consequently the valet who
his will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the
his words apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible
his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six
his wraps with the aid of his servant and not looking at pierre with
his wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly he
his youngest boy had all settled down in the drawing room and were
hissing chuckle and speranski in a highpitched staccato manner
historian to each event as soon as historians of different
historian will prove that the national convention the directory
historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good
historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various
historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the
historians describe the affair as follows
historians have supposed but by the activity of all the people who
historians language
historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole
historians of that kind contradict each other even in their
historians of the third class assume that the will of the people
historians relate the aim of the russians was to stop the french
historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the
historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that
historians stop halfway
historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns
historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is
historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not
historians who assume that the collective will of the people is
historians who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of
historians who have described the event
historians who regard all historical persons from monarchs to
historic characters and nations
historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they
historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have
historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to
historic units battles campaigns periods of war into such
historical characters that is reestablish the inevitable
historical movement is hard to understand only the following
historical ratiocination any farther when actions are clearly
historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth
histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and
history
history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all
history carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible
history civil wars revolutions and conquests are presented by
history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
history has not done this having in theory rejected the view held
history has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy
history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which
history he concluded
history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put
history of selfsacrifice and a present conciousness of the future
history of that period nor would there have been any contradictions
history of the events
history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover
history of the year 1812 the character of kutuzov and
history or what is called by that name replying to these questions
history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples
history reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they
history seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known to
history tells us the expression of that will is independent of time
history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind
history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the

i see im intruding rostov repeated
i see someone with a mustache said natasha seeing her own face
i see those eyes thought natasha and what do his father and sister

i shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be
i shall not be at peace till you promise me this
i shall probably die before you so remember these are my memoirs
i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality
i shant be violent dont be afraid said pierre in answer to a
i shant believe anyone i know she doesnt like me replied
i should be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to
i should have been proud to let him see us there now you talk of

i should like to go to kuragins thought he
i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how
i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon
i should like to speak well of them but as far as i the facts i
i should never dare to say that i know the truth said the
i should never never have believed that one could be so happy
i should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones and
i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of
i should think he has a score of them
i should think not said vera because there can never be
i should think so he replied i have felt like that when
i should think so replied natashas laughing eyes
i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it
i speak bluntly staining the honor of a soldier

i think however that these condemnations have some ground
i think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the old
i think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic
i think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued
i think no one has been more courted than she she went on but
i think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but
i think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be
i think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive
i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now
i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been
i think shes asleep mamma said sonya softly
i think that before discussing these questions pierre
i think this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was
i thought perhaps something had happened she said with her

idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow
idea of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach
idea of throwing her brother and natasha together amused her
idea that le principe des monarchies est lhonneur me parait
idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army
ideas and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of
ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action seeing
ideas of these days i said so even at the time when everybody was
identical

in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane

in good spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in

in his husbandry
in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with

in his oldfashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone
in his opinion the sole cause of the whole disaster and with
in his pocket folded up his papers and called in alpatych who had
in his pocket left the shed
in his power and so that way of life proved economical
in his saddle
in his sight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears
in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of
in his study the old prince went for his walk as usual next
in his usual tone of indifference
in his wifes drawing room and he was almost always there had a

in historical works on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of
in history some people regard giving a constitution to poland and
in history we find a very similar progress of conviction
in hot haste after the battle speaks of the shevardino redoubt as the
in how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat
in i think there is little need for discussion the emperor has
in immense force upon kutuzovs line of communication with the

in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him

in october 1805 a russian army was occupying the villages and

in ordered petya and at first from afar he heard mens voices and
in ordinary life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely
in our battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you
in our house arent they
in our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the
in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal this
in passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to anna
in peace let us pray unto the lord
in peace the old man was beside himself moved the chair on which
in perkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that
in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could
in perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
in perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my
in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to
in petersburg
in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of
in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being
in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the
in petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant
in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee
in petersburg which seemed to him stupid and made forcible and
in petersburg with her husband took a very prominent place she was
in pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance
in pierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but
in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of
in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed
in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a

in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army
in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that
in quite ready with a fan in her hand no shes altogether
in rank i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose
in rank the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich count
in raptures about him when he had just returned from abroad and
in red bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk
in regard to philanthropy the greatest virtue of crowned heads
in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences
in reply boris wrote these lines
in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of
in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison count
in reply to the counts anxious inquiries as to why she was so
in returning
in russia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg
in russian for they were speaking french at least with a russian who
in search of provisions rostov found a family consisting of an old
in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing
in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and
in she asked natasha here hand some fruit jelly to the turk she
in short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude
in silence and then the same joke was repeated
in so that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared
in social standing something always drew him toward those richer
in society and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter
in society of composure and imperturbable selfpossession if a man
in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of
in spain and in russia and that the movements from the west to the
in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused
in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible
in spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust
in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of
in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders
in spite of the obscurity of the soldiers words pierre understood
in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which
in spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features
in statistics what is mans responsibility to society the conception
in store for him
in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the
in suvorovs time now passing so gallantly before the emperors
in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the
in that case began willarski but pierre interrupted him
in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack
in that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at your
in that column
in that drawing room
in that last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was
in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but
in the act of falling asleep rostov lifted his head that had sunk

in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war
in the autumn the rostovs returned to moscow early in the winter
in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that
in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feeling
in the battery several men were lying about who had not been removed
in the beginning of the winter of 18056 pierre received one of anna
in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would
in the boxes especially at helene in the next box who apparently
in the brightest frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as
in the carriage as pale as anything how they made the four black

in the counts house such were dimmler the musician and his wife
in the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of
in the courtyard and wished to see him
in the crowd carrying petya with it streamed forward into the
in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage
in the dark corner and this someone was he the devil and he was
in the darkness he took the boys hand and pressed it
in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was
in the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed above
in the daytime and at night there were the campfires the lice that
in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard
in the deep the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but
in the dining room
in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was
in the direct work
in the direction indicated at the back entrance stood his caleche
in the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply
in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
in the distance and he listened to the sounds of firing in the
in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how

in the drawing room from habit and pierre answered the countess
in the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle
in the drawing room the conversation was still going on
in the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was already
in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that
in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a
in the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
in the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatole
in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and
in the evening michael ivanovich sent by the prince came to

in the evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse
in the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentleman the rather
in the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mitenka out by the scruff
in the faint morning light
in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had

in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his

in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of herself her
in the gray haze it grew light the evening was ending but the night
in the hall and anteroom as if someone had arrived
in the hall she met her father who had returned with bad news
in the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home and
in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties
in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the
in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in
in the hounds while the borzoi whips with a cry of atugalloped
in the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
in the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna
in the hussars
in the hut which the men had passed the chief officers had gathered
in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final
in the least fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels
in the legion dhonneur of which napoleon was himself the head
in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of
in the life of the russian people the causes and meaning of which are

in the men such as i had never seen before that we had held the

in the middle of a sober conversation begun by ilagin about the
in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot
in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze
in the middle of the streets both the russians and the french
in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected

in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the
in the middle of what he was saying
in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna
in the midst of a description of the last petersburg fete she
in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs
in the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest
in the miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg had just been
in the mist
in the mood he then was this was not even unpleasant to him
in the moonlight
in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights
in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre
in the morning from a foraging expedition rostov in his cadet
in the morning natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the

in the necessities of life the french did not need to be informed
in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these
in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are
in the passage denisov with a pipe was squatting on the
in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable

in the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with
in the porch had resulted
in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing the evil and
in the presence of tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had
in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness she thought
in the rear as the right flank would probably not be able to

in the refreshment room and the hall footmen were bustling about with
in the room all were silent
in the room but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little
in the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers
in the room with the inkstand in her hand
in the rostovs staid oldfashioned house the dissolution of
in the same pitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share
in the same way as twenty years before it seemed impossible that the
in the same way thought natasha feeling with horror a sense of
in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite
in the samovar but rostov went off to his squadron without waiting
in the sea of mist in front and behind moved infantry the
in the seclusion of our lodge we must act act we are drowsing
in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there
in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability
in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like

in the spring of 1809 he went to visit the ryazan estates which

in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps with

in the summer of 1809 pierre returned to petersburg our
in the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularly
in the sushchevski or the rogozhski quarter
in the tavern before which stood the doctors covered cart there
in the third category he included those brothers the majority
in the third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk
in the town and was it true pierre laughed and said it was
in the tula and ryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni
in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to

in the village outside the drink shop another meeting was being
in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a

in the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on
in the yard and in the house the count bad been out since morning
in the yards and huts of that large village the rostovs servants and
in the year 1812 when news of the war with napoleon reached

in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in
in their covered cart the officers lay down in the tavern covering
in their exposition an historic character is first the product of his

in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her
in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes these are
in them they were not clear they were too onesidedly personal and
in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most
in this crazy world
in this lies the purpose of the bee but the ultimate purpose of the
in this life to love her husband her children little nicholas and
in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of

in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the

in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people
in various uniforms two of them rode side by side in front at full

in which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious
in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from

in which her eyes now looked larger than ever
in which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for

incalculable wealth is in napoleons hands the russian army only
incapable of considering what might come of such lovemaking as he

it all be unjust and what is justice the princess never thought
it all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor
it all got done as if of its own accord toward night candles were
it all up today
it and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that
it and as he went on became more and more animated he told them of
it and be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that
it and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning
it and involuntarily waded kneedeep in the bog

it but coming toward him he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping

it but the next day the following communication was received from
it but the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once
it but what a kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at

it cant be helped men must sometimes have masculine
it cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and
it cant be said rostov it must have been someone else

it completely so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait
it continued to dress while walking about and three times
it could not be done because the flagging spirit of the troops
it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard
it did not now occur to him to think of russia or the war or
it does one good it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count
it doesnt matter to me i only wish it for your sake

it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment
it had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that
it had to perish bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at
it happened in the greatest of all known wars
it hard except by a great effort to realize the danger and the
it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood
it has cost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under
it has your majesty
it have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible
it he corrected himself has shown or displayed in the battle of

it is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running
it is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the
it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may
it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if
it is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a

it is ready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had
it is robbery youll answer for it sir said the infantry
it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those
it is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a
it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want
it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not
it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte
it is the sword of frederick the great which i she began but
it is the talk of all moscow my word i admire you
it is then at last that famous city it was high time
it is too late now its done besides i love her thought pierre
it is true believe it
it is true that natasha is still young but so long as that
it is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh
it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because
it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real
it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor
it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer
it is your excellency replied the adjutant
it isnt wanted petya tell them to take it away replied
it it was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of
it it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in
it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i
it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark
it losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of
it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to
it matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see its
it may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar its
it may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the
it may end there will always be people to say i said then that it
it may turn to pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from
it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said
it means that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the
it might be should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how
it might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began
it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to
it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back
it must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away
it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to
it must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will
it must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him and that must
it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any
it now
it now you shall judge between us i always tell him here he is
it occurred to him if the answer to the question were contained in
it on the fire
it one of the least significant parts of the field
it or because the boy standing below wants to eat it
it originated
it out at all
it out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift
it out to me
it over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between
it paid to serve him rostov patted the horses neck and then his
it polite to return the young counts compliment ilagin looked at his
it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed
it prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling
it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he
it ran
it really but he did not say what it really was for the
it really was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces
it resembles caesar and alexander the great and is therefore good
it seem odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and
it seemed as if from some words boris had spoken that evening
it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words
it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed
it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it
it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him like that to be
it seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid
it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but
it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen
it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically
it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and
it seemed to him that it was getting lighter to the left he saw a
it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to
it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking
it seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince
it seemed to pierre
it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant
it seemed to princess mary
it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this
it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur
it seems as much alive as other hives
it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should
it seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he
it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have
it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors
it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as
it seems they say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove
it seems to be that you cant love me that i am so plain
it seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views
it she knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer and she
it she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess
it she waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and
it she was going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing
it she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from
it slink in among the french or walk more than thirty miles in a

it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the
it suggested the liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy and yet it was
it take this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his
it that we are staying on
it then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable
it this question absorbed all his mental powers all else was to
it to him
it to him alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially
it to natasha it was a letter from princess mary
it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own
it to the emperor
it took ones breath away the rate we flew we came across a train of

it two of the commanders of large parties one a pole and the other a

it up without reading it and reread his fathers letter ending with

it vont go begging replied the german with a smile

it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special
it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the emperors
it was a fine day sunny after rain and the air was unusually pure
it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters
it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he
it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no
it was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding
it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been
it was a noxious plant that spring a new disease broke out broke
it was a portrait painted in bright colors by gerard of the son
it was a small estate that brought in no profit replied prince
it was a system a concurrence of circumstances
it was a very good thing as those vehicles could be used to carry
it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the
it was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four
it was a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch
it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both
it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened out
it was a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army
it was about eleven oclock the sun shone somewhat to the left
it was agreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss
it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it she
it was all attention she did not lose a word no single quiver in
it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by
it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the
it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the
it was already growing dusk when denisov petya and the esaul
it was already late when he rose after sealing the letter he wished
it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the
it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he
it was as if they had not known each other till now both liked to
it was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo news of the
it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills and
it was by now late in the afternoon half the street was in
it was clear and frosty above the dirty illlit streets above the
it was committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself
it was decided to move to tarutino only when the army had got
it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there
it was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of
it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish
it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he
it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such
it was evident that prince andrews ironical tone toward the
it was evident that this strange strong man was under the
it was far from being the same words or the same order that
it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brickred
it was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the
it was good indeed excellent moreover the rostovs affairs were
it was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many
it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud
it was impossible first because as experience shows that a
it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken
it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at
it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of
it was impossible to give battle before information had been
it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year
it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that
it was in french
it was in july 1805 and the speaker was the wellknown anna
it was inevitable
it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled
it was just then that he received a letter from his wife who
it was just this peculiarity of speranskis mind that particularly
it was just when the counts affairs had become so involved that
it was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his
it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz
it was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he
it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas not till
it was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with
it was napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp bonaparte riding
it was nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when the
it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the
it was necessary his income would be reduced by three fourths but he
it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save
it was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a
it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through
it was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew
it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary
it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the
it was not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life
it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already
it was now with the inhabitants of moscow it was long since people
it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for
it was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume
it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness
it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to
it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown
it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given
it was only for buying too many and too expensive things to her other
it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost
it was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or
it was out of the question for her to refuse him and therefore
it was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a
it was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at
it was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was not
it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but
it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift
it was plain that this well referred to much that they both
it was pleasant after his reception by the austrians to speak if not
it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love
it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the
it was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor
it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he
it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a
it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle
it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the
it was st natalias day and the name day of two of the rostovs the
it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were
it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
it was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the
it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the
it was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december 1820 natasha
it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his
it was the officer your honor stained it answered the
it was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the
it was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shone
it was three oclock in the morning the footmen came in with sad
it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and
it was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already
it was your sons turn to be conscripted but no fear you
it we never hear a word but dolokhov is mentioned they swear by him
it well i have asked you and now i wont interfere any more
it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the
it were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and
it were not his he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find
it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years but the moment
it were the breathing of that great and beautiful body
it will all pass natasha
it will be carried out we must part so find some place for

it will interest you said he
it will one day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to
it with one finger the yard porter his arms akimbo stood smiling
it wont be just yet someday think what fun it will be when i
it wont be your skirmishing at durrenstein or gunpowder at all that
it wont do my love not everyone will understand this
it wont hurt that devil hes as strong as a horse they said
it worth tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in
it wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove
it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature
it would be better to put a in bs place and b in ds or on the
it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has
it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case
it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems
it would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon
it would be if things were different
it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of
it would fall upon his doting old head planning beforehand what he
it would have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently
it would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i
it would have been senseless first because napoleons
it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but
it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow
it would roll on its back yelping with delight now bask in the sun
it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in
it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
it you lead that man away said he quickly and energetically and
italian campaign sat on his small gray arab horse a little in front
italian dio mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi

italian was as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed
italians face instantly changed and assumed an offensively

its advance into the heart of russia late in the season without any
its all about the war the count shouted down the table you
its all gods scourge said dron what horses we had have been
its all nonsense all rubbish those discussions which lead to
its all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices
its all over but i am a coward yes a coward thought rostov
its all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a
its all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805 they
its all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theres
its all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to
its all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a
its all the same to me he said i only want to see whether
its all this mania for opposition he went on and who for it
its all up im lost thought he now a bullet through my brain
its all very well for you i am not envious i love you and
its all very well for you ivan sidorych to talk said the first
its ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a

its arm he began to laugh
its as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are
its as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose
its as the old men have decided theres too many of you giving
its attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it
its awful oh its awful awful natasha suddenly cried and
its because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the
its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long
its breakfasts lunches dinners and suppers provided out of the
its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzovs
its certainly well written said tushin but thats not the
its definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held
its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine
its different on different days answered the captain one day
its dirt and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of
its dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace
its drooping tail
its effect
its empty
its examination is great and where the causes of the action are
its fine lads now its raging its fine
its general aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with
its getting light its really getting light he exclaimed
its good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french

its here close by said she and running across the yard opened
its horrid its abominable she screamed you cant possibly
its impossible replied another
its in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow
its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events and by its
its laws
its like a portable house that fellows dropped his sack and
its like this he said thoughtfully if theres a battle soon
its lucky for him that he escaped me but ill find him she said
its more to the left why little mytishchi is over there and
its my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why doesnt he
its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
its no joke this plot youve hatched
its no joke you know its all very well if youre single one
its nonsense
its not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up and
its not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside
its not my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one
its not nonsense papa fedya obolenski is younger than i and

its ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it
its sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a
its shameful sir he said to the adjutant what
its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing
its supplies subsequently the in activity of the french who even
its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury a
its that protege of yours that sweet princess drubetskaya that
its that that said sonya with a white face and trembling
its the business of us soldiers but in a gentleman its
its the enemy no yes see it is for certain but
its them gracious heavens o lord four of them horsemen she

its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last

jammed in on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had
jauntily back on one side of his head as he rode up to the camp he
jaw came out of the room prince andrew turned to him but the doctor
je vous aime he said remembering what has to be said at such
jealousy of her brothers love for her apart from this insuperable

jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a

journeys and occupations the war and so on the preoccupation and
joy princess mary in her position as absolute and independent
joy which expressed itself by laughter
joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into gods own
joyful but an animal squirrellike expression she paused as if
joyful delight and brotherly love wagged their heads in token of
joyful emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that
joyful feeling in the depth of his heart in one place the peasants
joyfully as though she had not expected it to the charm of the notes
joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded
joyfully received a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was
joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty
joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant
joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her
joyous emotion her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately
joyous laugh having finished the dance well done niece now a fine

joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are generally
joys of his life and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of
joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid

kutuzov accepted the battle while napoleon who was said to be a
kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind
kutuzov affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front gave
kutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited
kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion
kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town the commander in
kutuzov and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue orders
kutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the
kutuzov bowed with the same smile
kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen
kutuzov chose this latter course
kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond

kutuzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to
kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he
kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause
kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over

kutuzovs gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible his
kutuzovs groom leading horses in horsecloths then came a cart and

kutuzovs order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was
kutuzovs party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff boris
kutuzovs place was taken by a new and necessary performer

napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa
napoleon exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this
napoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencing
napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head
napoleon gazed silently in that direction
napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his
napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
napoleon has left moscow are you sure eh

napoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these last
napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so
napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently

napoleon smiled and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to the
napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and
napoleon so not one of the orders in the disposition was or could
napoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and
napoleon stood with his marshals around him it was quite light above

napoleons army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing
napoleons arrangements the maneuvers and his profound plans which
napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and the general temper
napoleons commands that they killed their fellow men

napoleons generals davout ney and murat who were near that

napoleons historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at
napoleons louises and authors we ought to be shown the
napoleons own see what horses and the monograms with a crown

natasha and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly
natasha and of her own youth and of how there was something unnatural

natasha gave boris a similar smile
natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling
natasha gave him her hand and went out princess mary on the other
natasha gazing at helene with wideopen wondering eyes
natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why
natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded
natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew
natasha go away sonya i dont want to quarrel with you but go
natasha got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as
natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly
natasha had announced her demands pierre was greatly surprised by his
natasha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits
natasha had countermanded an order of his and the servants now came
natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
natasha had made a strong impression on kuragin at supper after the
natasha had married in the early spring of 1813 and in 1820 already
natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not
natasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonski
natasha he did not purposely say things to please her but whatever
natasha he had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and
natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed
natasha he is no more no more
natasha he noticed her watching him raised his eyes and began to
natasha he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him
natasha he said you know that i love you but

natasha i love you too much more than anything in the world
natasha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his
natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour princess ill drive
natasha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich said she
natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and
natasha is not quite well shes in her room and would like to
natasha its magical isnt it
natasha kept turning to helene and to her father as if asking what it
natasha kissed her on the hair
natasha knew by the sound of his voice
natasha knew it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince
natasha knew so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly
natasha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so
natasha knew was covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and
natasha knew why he mentioned mityas likeness to nicholas the
natasha last saw him he passed up to the front rows not noticing
natasha laughed and the countess too smiled slightly
natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
natasha left the room with her father and as if finding it
natasha liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order
natasha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing
natasha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking
natasha looked at her inquiringly
natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look
natasha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyes
natasha looked at sonya with astonishment evidently this question
natasha looked at sonya with wideopen eyes as if she could not
natasha looked at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and
natasha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor
natasha looked at vera with guilty happy faces
natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded
natasha looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed
natasha looked in the direction in which her fathers eyes were
natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her
natasha looked intently at him and went on
natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the
natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love
natasha moaned sonya aghast
natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her
natasha natasha came countess marys frightened whisper from the
natasha natasha cried the countess its not true its
natasha natasha was calm though a severe and grave expression had
natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when
natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
natasha now its your turn sing me something they heard the
natasha of former days her features were more defined and had a calm
natasha of hopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside
natasha of whom he had just been thinking

natasha pale and stern was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and
natasha pale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the
natasha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a
natasha put her hand on her mothers mouth
natasha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her mother
natasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner
natasha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed
natasha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla
natasha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the
natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the
natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom
natasha remained alone and from the time princess mary began making
natasha remained constantly at her mothers side sleeping on a lounge
natasha remained silent from shyness marya dmitrievna supposed but
natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so
natasha rostova the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his
natasha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i
natasha sat down and without joining in boris conversation with
natasha sat erect gazing with a searching look now at her father
natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
natasha seeing the impression the of her brothers wound produced
natasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant
natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded
natasha she felt that from her she would be able to understand and
natasha she murmured
natasha she said just audibly
natasha smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but just
natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking
natasha smiled bashfully
natasha smiled rapturously
natasha smiled through her tears
natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window
natasha sonya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas
natasha spoke to pierre about her brothers life and doings of
natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass the dress
natasha stepped up to the window and pondered
natasha stopped abruptly
natasha stopped him
natasha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was
natasha stopping suddenly i feel so happy
natasha suddenly flushed
natasha that winter had for the first time begun to sing
natasha the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary
natasha the young melyukovs favorite disappeared with them into
natasha though with the intimacy now established between the
natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to
natasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and
natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his
natasha took the first note her throat swelled her chest rose her
natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young
natasha undress darling lie down on my bed
natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness
natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy
natasha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all
natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think
natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing
natasha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to
natasha was going to her first grand ball she had got up at eight
natasha was ill and her engagement broken off and that he would do
natasha was listening and considering
natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the
natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that they did
natasha was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a
natasha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her
natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809 the very year to which
natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated
natasha went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive
natasha went to the table and without a moments reflection wrote
natasha went up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer
natasha went up to the monk for his blessing and advised her to
natasha what are you about come here said the countess
natasha what is it about she asked what do they matter to you
natasha which was most delighted lisa im sure
natasha who felt her glance did not look at her all three were
natasha who had borne the first period of separation from her
natasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at
natasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby
natasha who sat opposite was looking at boris as girls of thirteen
natasha who though shy went on carefully executing her steps
natasha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on
natasha who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly
natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure
natasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natasha
natasha whose radiant happy expression of which he was conscious
natasha why this secrecy
natasha with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set
natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked
natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres
natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother
natasha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say
natasha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper
natasha you would not deceive me youll tell me the whole truth
natasha youd better lie in the middle said sonya
natasha your hair whispered sonya
natashas affianced lover
natashas elopement with additions
natashas engagement to bolkonski and that the wedding would be in
natashas explanation it really seemed that sonya did not feel her
natashas face eyes would eyes would have to tell her all more clearly
natashas face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical
natashas face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly
natashas face twitched she frowned and lowered her eyes for a
natashas face which had been so radiantly happy all that saints
natashas grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that
natashas illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for
natashas intermediacy to remind him of his promise and then thanked
natashas italian singing master thats why shes ashamed
natashas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she
natashas lips twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and
natashas looks as everyone told her had improved in the
natashas occupations the childrens upbringing were all selected
natashas prediction proved true dolokhov who did not usually care
natashas soul was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation
natashas talk and especially a quick glance sonya gave her
natashas voice broke she blushed pressed her clasped hands on her
natashas wedding to bezukhov which took place in 1813 was the
natashas wish and entrusted her to belova agrafena ivanovna used

nicholas and julie were saying to one another the governess kept
nicholas and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel
nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince
nicholas and running out from the porch he went round the corner of
nicholas and sonya that when one goes on and on recalling
nicholas animation vanished he waited for the first pause in the
nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most
nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that
nicholas began pacing up and down the room
nicholas bolkonski
nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper
nicholas bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the
nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of sonyas feet in her
nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god

nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the
nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping
nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess
nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in
nicholas disliked being waked then through the door she heard
nicholas dismounted and with natasha and petya who had ridden
nicholas dont tell me that she said
nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the
nicholas first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with
nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakhar stretching out his
nicholas get up natashas voice was again heard at the door
nicholas glanced at her and wishing to appear not to notice her
nicholas glanced round at sonya and bent down to see her face
nicholas groom
nicholas has received a st georges cross i am so proud of him
nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not
nicholas have you come come here dear called the old
nicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without
nicholas having exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was
nicholas he wanted to be learned wise and kind like pierre in
nicholas he wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been
nicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that
nicholas i never knew any madame jacquot
nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas
nicholas ill explain to you go away listen mamma darling
nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the
nicholas in his old ladys dress over which he had belted his
nicholas incoherently and blushing
nicholas into an old maid like yourself a pity prince andrew wants
nicholas is going as a cadet theres no one to interest himself for
nicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers have
nicholas laughing dear dear
nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were
nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he
nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and
nicholas lowered his legs rose and took his daughter in his arms
nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more
nicholas might come in to say good night
nicholas natasha and uncle flew reckless of where and how they
nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut
nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and
nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was
nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and
nicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting
nicholas pray come and see me
nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the
nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar the
nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant
nicholas quickly changing his attitude
nicholas refused the match she had found for him she would have to
nicholas relations and of princess marys
nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments
nicholas rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full
nicholas rostov meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the
nicholas rostov served and which was in prince bagrations detachment
nicholas rostov turned away and as if searching for something
nicholas rostov with denisov and his new acquaintance dolokhov
nicholas said countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am
nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and
nicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside julie karagina
nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending
nicholas says we ought not to think but i cant help it besides
nicholas scratching milka behind the ears
nicholas sent the man to call natasha and petya to him and rode
nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the
nicholas she said turning to her brother as if asking him what
nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his
nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya together with his
nicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for a
nicholas started angrily
nicholas stepmother and ill marry bourienne ha ha ha he
nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the
nicholas the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter
nicholas this
nicholas though free from denisovs readiness to find fault with
nicholas though he had never seen ilagin with his usual absence of
nicholas to be saying
nicholas too was greatly pleased by uncles playing and uncle
nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother
nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the
nicholas tried to say yes but could not and he nearly burst into
nicholas turned away from her natasha too with her quick instinct
nicholas was about to stab her but daniel whispered dont well
nicholas was all sonya said instantly turning white
nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed

nobility and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully
nobility because it involved him in too much expense but still his
nobility sonya with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the
nobility were to stand when the emperor entered when a ball should be
noble but i am unable to follow in that gentlemans footsteps if you
noblemans uniform that had become too tight for him he was agitated
nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds

nodding come get on you shall have three rubles for vodka get
nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye
noise of the crows flying from moscow across the field and when
noiseless steps lifted the curtain and dropped it again behind
noiselessly
noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound began
non diteslui que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse
non madame he smiled quite inappropriately
nonchalance intended to show that as a highly trained military man
noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in
noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the
none
none of all that turmoil of the world at large where he did not
none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know
none of its honeyed firmness and softness
none of the prisoners said a word
none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and
none of them not even the middleaged dimmler wanted to break
none of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even
none of these steps
nonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute the
nonobservance of the continental system the duke of oldenburgs
nonreceipt of our dispatch of november 18 that is how it will end
nonsense
nonsense but this is real now then natasha now then dearest
nonsense but we are friends forever she if she loves anyone does
nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs he asked everyone
nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood
nonsense he repeated but still he patted pierre affectionately on
nonsense he thought the slur on my name and honor thats all
nonsense i tell you your mothers milk has hardly dried on your
nonsense indeed i am telling you the fact said natasha
nonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to
nonsense one might kill and rob and yet be happy
nonsense out of anybody but probably realizing that he was
nonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment
nonsense out of your head
nonsense rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets they knew that it was
nonsense that might be told them there was nothing left for them to

nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do

nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of

nor of the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that

nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace
nose red and his voice hoarse involuntarily listening with downcast
nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin
noses he added

not angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what did he
not answer for the consequences
not any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe
not apply for leave in order to see natasha before she was married
not as the daughter of prince vasili but visualized her whole body
not at all mamma
not at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had his

not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders so near
not by my fault
not captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought
not changing the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you
not cherish any hope he made up his mind that prince andrew had
not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages weyrother
not come from god to whom he had prayed but by some ordinary

of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and
of such efforts the enemy had fled experienced a similar feeling of
of such music

of taking anything from them often gave them the last of their

of terror went through him no better not look he thought but
of that army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two
of that battery led the french to suppose that here in the center

shaken and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we we
shaking and swaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as
shaking her little shriveled finger at him
shaking himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps
shaking his head
shaking his head in perplexity perhaps because the banner really

she added as if to explain such a question
she added hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have asked
she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant
she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as
she approached him saw his face and something gave way within her
she asked
she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and
she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband
she attempted concealment or tried to extricate herself from her
she began asking dron about the peasants needs and what there was
she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness
she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her if she
she brought a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves made with honey
she called her back
she called her protegee aside
she came in and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger
she came in to dinner with red eyes marya dmitrievna who knew
she cannot be a bad woman he had often begun to make reflections
she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity
she constantly divined once she began questioning him about his
she contemplated between anatole and the little princess
she continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at
she could not enter
she could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in
she could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more
she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
she could not refrain from weeping at these words touched that this
she could see the raised hood of prince andrews caleche she did
she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice
she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself
she crossed her path everywhere andrew may wake him
she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to andrew
she did not cease chattering goodnaturedly and gaily continually
she did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the
she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her
she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked
she did not stir she was in just the same position in which marya
she did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as
she did the right thing with such precision such complete
she does i know pierre cried fiercely
she dont let me perish with my little children folks she says
she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it
she drew nearer to him her face flushed
she drove to her daughters early one morning so as to find her alone
she existed any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it
she fail to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french
she faltered you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich
she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though
she felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words
she felt through her happiness that there is another sort of
she felt unhappy she asked him where he had been he replied she
she finished her game of patience and only then examined the
she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her
she gave her six yearold nephew to her consternation she detected in
she got up and almost crying began to arrange her wallet she
she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the
she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had
she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles
she had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasili
she had counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed four
she had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to
she had dwelt for the first fortnight she received letters from her
she had ever had
she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first
she had known and always slightly feared he was in a womans dress
she had meant
she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not
she had not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she
she had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the
she had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the
she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had
she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was
she had seen lying down
she had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round
she had sometimes to exercise her stillexisting faculty of
she had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole
she had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at
she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at
she had written that wretched profligate pierre had not replied
she has come to stay with me said princess mary the count and
she has millions oh yes thats the french ambassador himself she
she has nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be
she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing shes
she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed
she heard or thought she heard the names of kuragin and bolkonski
she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street
she heard through the door made her immediately forget herself and
she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly
she herself did not understand made natashas breast heave and a
she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss did leave her
she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had
she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw
she insisted on having her own way and after that nursed all her
she invited them to take the wounded man into the house
she is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya and
she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she
she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious
she is dressed lovely and that stout one in spectacles is the
she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary
she is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to
she is not stupid she never was abashed and is not abashed now so
she is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a
she is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me
she is really and she is not at all so plain either
she is so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating
she is very ill said pierre
she is well but sad but do you know who rescued her it is
she kept begging to go away shes a woman take me away says
she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she taking
she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do
she knew what she ought to have said to natasha but she had been
she laughed as she watched this slim graceful countess reared in
she lay on the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons
she leaned out from behind the apron and waving her thin arms from
she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one
she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the
she lived the more experience and observation she had of life the
she looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her
she looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach
she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room
she looked timidly at her brother
she loved and was beloved though she never said this definitely to
she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it
she loves you
she made a demand on pierre that he should all the same prefer her
she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she
she might and then kissed him
she might say something about him there she is again as if it
she might she would still be told the same all the way she had sat
she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself
she must be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage
she must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said he
she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone
she must see him she passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle
she needs rest said prince andrew with a frown dont you lise
she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied
she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly
she noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and
she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what
she only really took part when they recalled sonyas first
she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the
she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and
she paused as women always do expecting something after they
she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natasha
she paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to
she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very
she positively did not understand them
she praised the rostovs toilets they praised her taste and toilet
she prepared to set off that she had not heard from prince andrew
she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her
she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress
she put her large hand under natashas face and turned it toward
she raised her hand to prince andrews shoulder they were the
she ran to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to
she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room
she really is a dear little thing said rostov to ilyin who was
she received all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and
she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch
she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot
she rose
she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely
she roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking
she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry
she said
she said indicating an old man with a profusion of silvergray
she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a
she said rapidly she glanced at him
she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in
she said was true and appropriate yet strange to say everyone
she said with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears
she sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her
she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between
she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made
she sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to
she sat in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing
she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees
she saw herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for
she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as
she saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own
she saw nothing she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the
she says voices in the crowd were heard saying
she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
she shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of
she should marry the question was no longer whether this was
she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have
she show her worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it
she show no signs of secrecy or shame on the contrary with
she sighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though
she sighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust
she simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it
she smiled as she uttered his pet name andrusha it was obviously
she smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her
she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her going in
she spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate
she started flushed and sighed deeply
she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her husbands head
she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these
she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity
she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she
she thought everybody always has liked me and i am so willing to do
she thought he had always thought what he said then and she
she thought to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it
she to count rostov who had followed her in how can you live in
she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholy
she told herself that only she with her sinful nature could think
she told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit
she took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings from her huge
she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the
she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since
she touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful
she trembled all over and sat down on a chair
she tried to pass anna mikhaylovna but the latter sprang so as to
she turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly
she turned pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what
she turned round for a few seconds they gazed silently into one
she turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an
she understood all the gravity of her friends trouble
she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling
she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to
she used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogue among
she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
she wanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the
she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god
she was again hemmed in
she was agreeable and everything depend on her daughters
she was aiming
she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince
she was beloved and was happy in regard to it
she was certainly goodlooking and sensible no one up to now had
she was eventempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this
she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands
she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering
she was feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and simple
she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other
she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine
she was jealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty
she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her
she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the
she was nursing her boy when the sound of pierres sleigh was
she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in
she was satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple
she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room
she was speaking as usual in french and as if after long
she was talking to anatole about paris it was not calculation that
she was terribly close to him she already had power over him and
she was to have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests
she was twentyseven after the death of her brothers she had become
she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not
she washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch in
she went in and sat down by her husband
she went on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but
she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat
she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or
she whispered
she whispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time
she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz
she will go to the country
she will run away with him thought sonya she is capable of
she will there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not
she woke late that sincerity which often comes with waking showed
she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other
she would feel his absence very acutely she attributed immense
she would not let him go

shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features and then she saw his
shot and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out
shot gleamed in the darkness this was the last french attack and

shot was heard and then another at first irregularly at varying

something soothing in the knitting of stockings the needles clicked
something special is always said in such cases he thought but
something still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the
something sweet would you like some and petya ran out into the
something terrible
something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly
something that was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and
something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery

sometimes you know i have brought some with me here they are
somewhat differently prince andrew had thought and said that
somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he
somewhere and i shall run with them and it death is here above
somewhere and in general something extraordinary was happening and
somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not
somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some
son a dandy and ladykiller he attended some lectures somewhere
son anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you
son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away
son by both hands he cried now ive got you so take the sleigh and
son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a
son ilya only fancy i didnt know you at first do you remember how
son prince andrew blushed as he often did now natasha
son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 the old
son sonya the counts fifteenyearold niece and little petya
son was accustomed to understand him he led him to the desk raised
song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness
song proceeding from the house
songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing
sons letter
sons lying dead after many consultations and conversations the count
sons tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation
sons when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no
sonya
sonya again interrupted she gave him an imploring frightened look
sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall not
sonya and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the
sonya and fat little petya doubled up with laughter
sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing
sonya and sat down scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite
sonya and the maids were holding her arms
sonya are you asleep mamma she whispered
sonya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they
sonya became thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas
sonya because that poor darkeyed niece of hers was so meek so kind
sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed
sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs
sonya but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty
sonya but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender
sonya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of
sonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in
sonya did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not
sonya did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her
sonya do you remember asked nicholas
sonya dont believe her darling dont believe her do you
sonya embraced natasha and kissed her
sonya entered the room with an agitated face
sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of
sonya for there is nothing but good in her
sonya glanced at what she was doing and then went up to her mother
sonya go and wake him said natasha tell him i want him to come
sonya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to
sonya he tried to say thats capital of course shell forget
sonya heard this and natashas whisper
sonya interrupted him
sonya is it well with thee he asked from time to time
sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to
sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countess
sonya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with her
sonya made some reluctant reply
sonya natasha petya anna mikhaylovna vera and the old count
sonya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and
sonya nodded
sonya one cant doubt him one cant one cant dont you
sonya ought to understand that
sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand natasha glanced
sonya read painstakingly in her highpitched voice the count
sonya reproachfully
sonya said that natasha was in her bedroom natasha was sitting on
sonya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as
sonya sat down and natasha pinned the ribbon on differently
sonya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began
sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining
sonya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it
sonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
sonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never
sonya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true
sonya she thought glancing at that curledup sleeping little
sonya she was right he thought remembering what the governors
sonya sighed and made no reply the count petya madame schoss
sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously
sonya sighed sorrowfully
sonya slammed the door to a minute later they let the count in
sonya smiled
sonya smiled
sonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you
sonya stared openeyed at natasha unable to believe her ears
sonya stood beside her kissing her hair
sonya struck the first chord of the prelude
sonya the autumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with
sonya too all rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss
sonya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was
sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them
sonya wait a bit well pack everything into these said natasha
sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling
sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she
sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and
sonya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to
sonya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses
sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor marya dmitrievna for
sonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred
sonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew
sonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more
sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went
sonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand
sonya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are
sonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and
sonya what is the matter with you how can you said he
sonya what is this she cried twanging a thick string
sonya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how
sonya who sat weary but resolute at the samovar and questioned
sonya why doesnt he openly ask for your hand you know prince
sonya why go away
sonya will he live she asked sonya how happy i am and how
sonya wiped away her tears and went up to natasha again scanning
sonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her
sonya youve read that letter she demanded
sonyas costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows
sonyas letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer

sound of a drum and shouts of command and from the battery one saw
sound of a mans footstep and then her face resumed its cold and
sound of an explosion a whistle of splinters as from a breaking
sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder
sound of guns ahead of them
sound of horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars
sound of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who
sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm
sound of the oftrepeated passage of the sonata prince andrew stopped
sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince
sound of these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him
sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french in
sound of voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud

sound which immediately broke off the door of the private room opened
sounded all along the lines
sounded and youll be in a pretty position without your boots the
sounded still more firm and resolute

sounds before now heard nothing else on the right of the battery
sounds fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again
sounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure
sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village
sounds pleased him very much
sounds rolling her eyes

source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion

stretch and hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and

stretched away into the distance these were troops of beauharnais
stretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and

successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed
successfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
succumbing to irresistible youthful childish drowsiness but what
such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that
such a confession so natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by
such a deduction is indubitable as indubitable as the deduction
such a feat possible it was the attack in which he was said to have

such a fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly
such a life i cant decide or think properly about anything ones
such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the
such a position at borodino
such a time of the year
such an explanation from day to day he became more and more
such an expression of goodhumored complacency and gaiety though
such an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the

such buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such honeyandnut sweets
such calmness and selfassurance he had never seen so resolute yet
such companies of various sizes and characters there were some
such company
such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be
such excessive modesty and only desired and insisted that their
such inconvenience but in anna pavlovnas presence no one dared to
such is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian
such is the peoples will he alone during the retreat of the french
such love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling
such love stands between life and death when during those first days
such men as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a
such men for discerning the higher laws
such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future prince

that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave
that again the infantry
that aim was attained in the first place of itself as the french
that all men are equals and had more than once impressed on his
that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally and
that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of the
that always appear dependent on these two elements

that and of bonaparte himself i remember his limited selfsatisfied
that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and

that day
that day
that day countess helene had a reception at her house the french
that day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen
that day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to
that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the
that day in a dull and wretched mood at nine in the morning he heard
that day nicholas rostov received a letter from boris telling him
that day sent a manservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he
that day so on evstafeys representation pierre had to put off his
that dear loved face a new life force took possession of her and
that demand became generally known and the dignity of france was
that denisov had said was clever and to the point what the general
that depends on our luck in starting else why shouldnt we be

that drunken imbecile to account the frenchman listened in silence

that episode as of some childish longforgotten matter that was not
that even the prim visitor could not help joining in
that even then i felt it he thought i felt then that it was not
that evening
that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian
that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably
that evening marya dmitrievna was going to the akharovs and
that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle
that evening proud of dolokhovs proposal her refusal and her
that evening the rostovs went to the opera for which marya
that evening was this
that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he
that everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general
that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself
that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and
that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than
that example but everybody understood that the old man was
that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys
that exists between the expression of someones will and the execution
that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
that filled his swollen eyes he remembered everything and ecstatic
that firing count ostermanntolstoys adjutant came galloping from
that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was
that for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand
that force to be something quite different they see it in what is
that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as
that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop knew the danger of his
that from the point of view of observation reason and the will are
that gentleman evidently not sharing boris conception of the
that gesture rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored
that girl is such a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend
that girl shall be my wife
that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and
that guided the event
that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that
that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war
that had been cut short shes ridden all day like a man and is as
that had been foreseen the russian army of thirtyfive thousand men
that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten prince
that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a
that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like
that had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his
that had happened the evening before yes yes all that has
that had long since and often occurred to him during his military
that had not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously
that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across
that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual
that had to be done
that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and
that had weighed him down he felt young bright adroit and
that halfhour rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of
that handsome exterior that i loved in him i divined his noble
that happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed
that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything
that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the
that he could have spent so much time on such useless work
that he could not bear them
that he could not believe his eyes who are they why are they
that he could not go back on his word and his father sighing and
that he cried
that he did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess
that he did not to confess
that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to
that he entrusts our fine army to such as he consider that on our
that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had
that he forgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first
that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him
that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there in
that he had risen
that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness
that he had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him
that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince
that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his
that he is probably tired of them said another officer
that he knew whom he was dealing with der alte herr as in their
that he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place
that he might give way to emotion when with her might become
that he only appeared to be different but was really just like all of
that he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision
that he ought to be shot general bagovut a fighting old soldier of
that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and
that he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when
that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed
that he took a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly
that he understood his commanders wish
that he unexpectedly died
that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him
that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was
that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezukhovs
that he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his
that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this calm
that he was dangerously wounded
that he was doing the right thing prince vasili did everything to get
that he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget he
that he was looking at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his
that he was not a spire at all but only an old german ruin
that he was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and
that he was smiling contemptuously at my words and i wished really to
that he was talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who
that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had
that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter
that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving his
that he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign
that he would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that
that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could
that he would place himself at the head of the army gather round
that held the taper
that helene had great success and was honored was by the special
that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her fathers
that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and
that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the
that here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich all
that hesitation lasted only an instant the tsars foot in the
that higher world
that hint not feeling his former agility and boldness and under
that his answers did not express his personal views but the general
that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag and the horror of
that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the
that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off he grew confused
that his order had been executed an attendant came in with punch
that his whole mind was engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to
that history is written by learned men and so it is natural and
that however long it might be before he met kuragin despite his
that hut while denisov was speaking a general with a portfolio under
that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very
that i am leaving them tomorrow
that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything
that i can bweak napoleons line of communication
that i do not like him
that i dont live at all everything seems hateful to me myself
that i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into
that i the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general
that i was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and
that i was threatened with prison and had a mother who could not
that if only he could attain it it would be the end of all things
that if she did not go away it was all the same to him he declared
that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it
that if you consider yourself bound by your promise it will seem
that ill obey him and that he can order me about i will certainly go
that im a sharper so i advise you to be careful
that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live
that impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me
that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of
that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would
that in spite of everything no one can love you more than does
that in the army besides the subordination and discipline
that in the group was the very man who had killed the other
that in the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
that inexorable eternal distant and unknown the presence of which
that instant the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away
that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully
that iogel the dancing master gave for his pupils durings the
that is a question for ethics
that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us
that is alone and in full view of the emperor
that is always exciting especially to the young
that is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that
that is bezukhovas brother anatole kuragin she said indicating
that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite
that is enough for me said sonya blushing
that is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted
that is good
that is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in a
that is life said the old teacher
that is metempsychosis said sonya who had always learned well
that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many
that is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping
that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took
that is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning
that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a
that is the dutch ambassador do you see that grayhaired man
that is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the
that is the smolensk road acted simultaneously on him also
that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why
that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added
that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said
that is with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina said
that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas
that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in
that it never entered her head that the relations between him and
that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans
that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss
that it was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she
that it was due to the power of some other person besides this
that it was her relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not
that it was humiliating to look at the french rostov began shouting
that it was inevitable but he could not make up his mind to take
that it was little mytishchi burning set on fire by mamonovs
that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted
that it was useless to talk to the old man that he would never
that it will come out that youre already married why theyll
that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the fathers
that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on
that joy
that kind is that true
that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count
that kindly do as you are ordered
that knoll quite differently but boris shrugged his shoulders
that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew of
that kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements
that kutuzovs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his
that leader this is what historians of the first class say those
that letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew
that lifeless arm or whether some other thought flitted across his
that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasili with that
that light i want to weep for joy
that little creature could be this strong brave man this model son
that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above
that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready
that low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor
that made her flush it was helene natasha had not time to take off
that makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of
that makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind
that might destroy him occurred to his mind the russians might fall
that modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has
that moment after supper at prince vasilis when he spoke those words
that moment his legs grew cold and bare
that moment several voices began speaking together
that moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any
that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natasha
that moment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic
that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived
that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all
that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods
that morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and
that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in
that movement and those sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and
that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga
that movement is god and while there is life there is joy in
that must be either mary nikolievnas or the ivanovs
that must be very interesting said dessalles prince andrew is
that my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again
that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow for he
that my position is now a terrible one continued anna mikhaylovna
that napoleon agreed with mouton and that the army retreated
that napoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify his new
that napoleon wished to come to moscow grew angry abused the
that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man
that napoleons army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov but
that natasha had too much of something and that because of this she
that natasha saw she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of
that nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself
that nicholas received a promise from his mother that sonya should not
that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to

the evening however as the wifes face grew more flushed and
the evening of anna pavlovnas soiree the matter was mentioned to the
the evenings she blushed continually and was irritable it seemed

the faceted palace in the kremlin others insisted that as the
the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a

the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom
the fact that they found it very hot pierre however felt excited
the fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrushka

the family
the family as a whole like a cat she had attached herself not to the
the family but was kept all summer in moscow by his new duties
the family felt some constraint in intercourse with prince andrew
the family group broke up
the family natasha seemed livelier than usual but she was far less
the family solicitor and he says the same
the family the whole question resolves itself into not eating more
the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the
the famous mans personality
the farther edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces
the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly
the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into
the farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on
the farther side of the river
the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
the fashion but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest
the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of
the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed
the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son

the fire
the fire and pressed it there
the fire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french
the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings
the fire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house

the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry
the princess was as untidy as her father was tidy she put down the
the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified

the princess who had never liked pierre and had been particularly
the princess with the doctor and with all the people he now met
the principal guests he was just going to take it when dolokhov
the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable
the prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had

the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the

the purse
the purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the
the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished
the question is dealt with that for history this question does not
the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals
the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and
the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from
the question which has another opposite side based on the
the questions that had haunted him but because his conception of
the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented
the raft and talked
the rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from
the ramrod his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly
the range of fire they would have remained there for a long time
the range of their investigation
the rank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for
the ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their
the ranks said the captain softly
the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our
the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome fully

the rattle of wheels the tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger

the reader went on and then paused do you see shouted the youth
the reading the uhlan interrupted denisov
the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with
the rear and reached the front ranks carrying them off their feet and
the reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these
the reception hall michael ivanovich mademoiselle bourienne
the reception room not knowing what to do with his hands he was more
the reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka sprang
the rednosed captain and his drawnin stomach and mimicked his
the rednosed captain timokhin formerly dolokhovs squadron
the reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and
the regiment all was clear and simple the whole world was divided
the regiment and bogdanich knows it oh we do prize it old
the regiment broke up into companies which went to their
the regiment id ah well ill show that in action and for me
the regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on
the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to
the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the
the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered
the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company
the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion fearing to
the regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and
the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this
the regimental commanders face now that the inspection was happily
the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely
the reins
the reins and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying
the reins and started of his own accord
the relation of the people to their rulers
the remains of langerons and dokhturovs mingled forces were
the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly
the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
the reply she wrote also in french
the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been
the rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe
the reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared
the rest and the rest was no concern of his in the regiment
the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and with
the rest of what went on having made up his mind once for all that
the rest of you let me live like a man and think of my soul and of
the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
the retreat from maloyaroslavets when he had a free road into a
the revolution of the ideas of 1789 and so forth and at another
the rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his
the rhetors instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierres
the rice too
the richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought
the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
the right denisov stopped
the right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i
the right of the road
the right of the road the cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery
the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations
the right sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his guns
the right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any
the right thing was at an end and they were already admiring her
the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as
the right wing are heard the sharpshooters of morands division and
the river and so it is
the river and the crimean estate in order to make it possible all
the river between himself and the main body of the french on the
the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile
the river then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about
the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
the road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point
the road and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in
the road as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant
the road before them was safe from cossacks
the road passed through the forest the dew was imperceptible on the
the road the french would take was unknown and so the closer our
the road to the right beyond the dnieper which was the only
the road was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on
the rods would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant
the rogozhski gate thought he just then mavra kuzminichna
the roman and french codes into russian and he felt ashamed of
the room
the room
the room a few minutes later now our natasha has come to life you
the room and began to say something in french the governors face
the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining
the room denisov silently watched lavrushkas movements and when the
the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest
the room nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at
the room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of
the room she thought perhaps he would then have said to me what he
the room the prince again began speaking about his son about the war
the room with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early
the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night
the rostov family many fears that the invitation would not arrive
the rostov party spent the night at mytishchi fourteen miles from
the rostovs and spent the rest of the day there
the rostovs being announced the old prince had shouted that he did
the rostovs box her whole bosom completely exposed beckoned the old
the rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air
the rostovs had known from childhood and who had now become a wealthy
the rostovs he had been in moscow several times and had passed
the rostovs house and of his childish love for natasha was unpleasant
the rostovs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enough
the rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in
the rostovs monetary affairs had not improved during the two
the rostovs of bolkonski pierre could not refrain from making them
the rostovs position and his own he decided that the time had come
the rostovs remained in moscow till the first of september that is
the round face of a rostov entered the yard
the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation
the ruin of russia she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the
the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people
the rural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing
the russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its
the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the
the russian army many heroes have been described to us in verse and
the russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought
the russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff and also by
the russian army we picture that army without any leaders it could
the russian emperors aidedecamp is an impostor officers are
the russian entrenchments and the places where in line with them
the russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand
the russian left wing napoleon said it should not be done without
the russian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and
the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the
the russian prisoners with that detachment dolokhov said
the russian side though the condition and numbers of the french
the russian troops were passing through moscow from two oclock at
the russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had
the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern
the russian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with the
the russians and projects of giving battle and above all the
the russians are very devout replied balashev
the russians but it was not really so it appears so to us because we
the russians did not make that effort because they were not
the russians did not seek out the best position but on the
the russians half of whom died did all that could and should
the russians made that effort and the flame of battle burned slowly
the russians moved his army across the kolocha and the russians
the russians possessed would have been required
the russians retreated eighty miles to beyond moscow and the
the russians stared at pierre because they could not make out to
the russians stood in serried ranks behind semenovsk village and its
the russians they say fortified this position in advance on the
the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to
the rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room prince
the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the beast and it
the saber never had been sharpened can you do it
the sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as
the sad memories of old age but poetic youthful ones those
the saddles and junots spoon might be of some use but that cold
the saints id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to
the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was
the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his
the same and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness
the same and attempts in this direction have already been made
the same and he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this
the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we
the same as ever only showing still more irritability and
the same cleanliness the same stillness reigned there and inside
the same conclusion by another road that is to recognize 1 nations
the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and
the same evening that the prince gave his instructions to
the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and
the same happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of
the same his serf and huntsman
the same is done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not
the same kind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens
the same minute with those about him from his daughter to his serfs
the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and
the same mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely
the same order the name of prince andrew bolkonski appointed to the
the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort
the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced but
the same she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel
the same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of
the same state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering
the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind
the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the
the same time and that the italians cure consisted in removing
the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would
the same timid faces only somewhat older princess mary was still the
the same to me he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting
the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if
the same voice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under
the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted
the same youll be all right anywhere but look here give up
the scantily clad helene smiled at everyone in the same way and
the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side
the scene of the previous and of the impending battle some cossacks
the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many
the scent of flowers came in at the window helene was wearing a white
the schemes of reconstruction
the science explaining the whole creation and mans place in it to
the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the
the scope of our society let the mot dordre be not virtue alone
the score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree
the scoundrels
the scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer
the scraping of chairs then one of those conversations began which
the screaming children the mummers covering their faces and
the screams came
the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who
the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to
the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles
the season so that by the the time it reached vilna it numbered
the seat
the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation
the second hundred replied the cossack
the second method is to consider the actions of some one man a king
the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the
the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through
the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme
the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes
the secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscow
the senate chairs in the senate square and cook themselves meals
the senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address
the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natasha off her horse and
the serfs punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and
the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper
the seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a moments
the servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down with an
the servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional
the servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the
the servants say he is still the same
the servants the most reliable judges of their masters because they
the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the majordomo
the service he would run away and next day count ilya rostov though
the setting out of the table for boston the general sat down by count
the seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomons
the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always
the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run
the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and
the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall when they heard
the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long
the shed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little
the shed became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two
the shed full of animation but on seeing prince andrews face he felt
the shelter of the regimental commander higher than and different
the shirt
the shot heard from that spot of the dogs howl of the guilty
the shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was
the shoulder and then went up to the table where prince andrew
the shouts of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the
the shrine of the saint and now im from kolyazin master where a
the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna
the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for
the sick and wounded yet the stand made at krems and the victory over
the sick man nor turn to look at him but stood frowning by the
the sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and
the sides of his good horse bedouin and sitting as though falling
the sight of her father the terribly wild cries of her mother that
the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men
the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the
the sign of the eagle began to address the assembled people were
the signal said he
the signet ring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and
the significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires
the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
the silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not
the silence looked at natasha and at princess mary they had
the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in
the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the
the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzovs
the sister with the mole
the six rubbers he watched her and his friend
the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at
the sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon
the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible
the sky to which pierre had pointed and for the first time since
the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded
the sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses
the sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with
the sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out
the sleigh bore to the right drew up at an entrance and rostov saw
the slippery ice that covered the millpool
the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was
the small foot shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver and
the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty
the smallest connection with the event itself
the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
the smile vanished from speranskis white face which was much
the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken
the smoke letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings this
the smoke of campfires the soldiers kitchens
the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not
the smoking ruins of semenovsk which had been burned down could be
the smolensk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered
the smolensk mother of god another corrected him
the snow
the snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself
the snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor
the snow on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the
the snows maintained the life of this original peculiar and unique
the sobs in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself
the socalled battle of the three emperors that is to say a slow
the socalled partisan war began with the entry of the french into
the society gathered together at the governors was the best in
the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince
the soil still kept out in the fields by groundless fear listen
the sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of
the soldier fell got up and ran away but his comrade throwing
the soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that
the soldier said no more and the talk went on
the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince
the soldier turn back with your slut
the soldier was in the ranks and so on similarly a man who committed
the soldier who told stories called it femgalka karataev and others
the soldier who was driving the womans vehicle for trying to get
the soldier who was holding their horses
the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
the soldiers at the battle of borodino he had sought it in
the soldiers became aware that in front behind and on all sides
the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the
the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and
the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it
the soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
the soldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a
the soldiers in the yard hearing the shot came into the passage
the soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the
the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section
the soldiers quite bewildered they unlocked their shops and locked
the soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain
the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at
the soldiers stopped
the soldiers swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously
the soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could
the soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders
the soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile
the soldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensation
the soldiers who fired or transported provisions and guns should
the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side there were
the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the
the soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was
the soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire
the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact
the son
the son
the son had followed him like an eagle three steps at a time
the son lowering his eyes followed her quietly
the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth
the son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him
the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the
the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard
the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
the sound of hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and
the sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte
the sound of three more shots came from the gate
the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked
the sound of voices was heard
the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the
the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings
the sounds of her own voice passing a mirror she glanced into it
the sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even more
the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of
the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the
the southeast to parts where none of them had ever been they set off
the southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna
the sovereign for refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for
the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the
the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite
the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved and after several
the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass
the spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road
the spurs on his rapid agile feet while at every third beat his
the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers an
the squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to
the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire
the squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to
the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon
the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery which
the squadron quartermaster said lavrushka
the squadwon cant pass shouted vaska denisov showing his
the square
the staff
the staff captain
the staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and
the staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache

the staff captains question by a disapproving shake of his head
the staff of his division to explain his violence at the
the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode
the staff officer joined in the colonels appeals but bagration did
the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone
the staff that evening to the officer of the horse guards
the staff was holding a paper in his hand and called over all the
the stairs and embraced his sister
the stalls and the curtain rose
the state of his affairs he did not know at all how much he had what
the state of the soldiers boots more than half the mens boots
the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and
the step the silence continued only among the back rows of the
the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule
the steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested
the stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostovs did not move to
the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one

the stimulating influence of a june morning and could not refrain
the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse and at last sprang
the stone moskva and yauza bridges

the stores the prisoners and the marshals baggage train stopped
the stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire
the story and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people
the story and not only said nothing to encourage zdrzhinskis
the story prevented her from going on with it
the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point
the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable
the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did
the strange lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and
the strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who
the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact
the stranger but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a
the strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but
the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through
the straw in the cornfield all seemed fully absorbed in these
the street and the adjutants unceasing moans could still be heard
the street inside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the
the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of
the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of
the strength of conviction with which he spoke kutuzov looked down at
the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his
the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable
the striking of the blow or the death of napoleon but with
the stripes on their bodies heal and they are happy as before but it
the stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly
the stronger i know very well that count nicholas is too young ever
the struggling men and the fate of the redhaired gunner who had
the stud farms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended
the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking
the subject for history is not mans will itself but our
the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request
the subject of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not
the subject under discussion than those they are talking with
the subject which wholly engrossed natashas attention was her
the subjugation of a people a general historian looks for the cause
the subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were
the substance of the speeches infected him too he did not renounce
the suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible
the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them
the sufferings of a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to
the suite
the suite and a convoy of croats beside kutuzov sat an austrian

the sum of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and
the sum of them is 666 and that napoleon therefore the beast foretold
the sun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness
the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure
the sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting
the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight
the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in
the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air
the sunshine in the yard
the superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a
the superintendent of police who had that morning by count
the superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to
the superior officers who was acquainted with the higher authorities
the supports attached to tushins battery had been moved away in the

the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still
the swelling that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and
the symptoms of natashas illness were that she ate little slept
the table
the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience
the table denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a
the table he began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized
the table onto which he threw it
the table sat the countess with marya dmitrievna on her right and anna
the table to write to the governor
the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb
the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when
the tail of the gun carriage moved forward and not noticing the
the talk reverted to its former lively tone
the talk went off into merry jests and gossip
the talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of

the tall youth not noticing the disappearance of his foe waved his

the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and
the terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off
the theorists are often one sided and therefore one should not
the theory of the transference of the collective will of the
the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of

the thing over some conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish
the things these arent needed said she putting aside some plates
the third a pair of womens gloves he said dear brother these
the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
the third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently
the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that
the third day when something could have been done that army was
the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
the third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing
the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his
the third order was general campan will move through the wood to
the third thing what else was it you talked about and prince andrew
the third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre
the thought that this man did not and never would know any of
the thoughtful expression of his face
the thoughtful profile of her drooping face she moved and the ball

the time i stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me
the time in the second case it is the origin and the question of
the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying

the tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and the
the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if

their arms and their sabers in the air
their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in
their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated

their bands playing and by the grand dukes orders the men had
their belongings
their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break

there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and
there pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations
there rose before him the danube at bright noonday reeds the russian
there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be
there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this
there sonya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him
there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must
there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
there that the hounds had separated into two packs that somewhere
there that was what the officers desired but it was impossible to
there thats just how she started and just how she came up smiling
there thats me the expression of her face seemed to say as she
there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so
there there are many stories of his getting to know an officer in
there there do you feel it i feel so strange and do you know
there there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to the
there there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts

there those stockings are to be a surprise for me
there to the church of st nicholas on the arbat where he had long
there twice fired his pistol so now the general explicitly forbade
there was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood
there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking
there was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess
there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general
there was a new feature in pierres relations with willarski with
there was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the
there was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so
there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire
there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of
there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll
there was a war near moscow there would be fighting at the town
there was an order not to move and that they would unharness the
there was in france a man of genius napoleon he conquered
there was in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future with
there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting
there was music and suddenly i felt so depressed
there was no answer to any of these questions except one and
there was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servants
there was no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the
there was no need to say more julies face shone with triumph and
there was no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from
there was no wind as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the
there was nobody else in the room addressed pierre
there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head and his whole
there was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied
there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness
there was nothing he could teach them all the powers of his soul
there was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled
there was nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i
there was nothing terrible in the one small distant fire in the
there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was
there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment
there was now an expression of quiet solemnity
there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili
there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one
there was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the
there was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty
there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into
there was only one hut available for the regimental commander
there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything
there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka
there was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of
there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather
there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was
there was such peace all around such blessedness that one dont want
there was the same furniture the same walls sounds and smell and
there we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before
there we had no idea never guessed at all
there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas moscow
there were as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible number of
there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone
there were in the room a childs cot two boxes two armchairs a
there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy but
there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one
there were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so
there were several prisoners from the french army in orel and the
there were soldiers everywhere all with expression and busy with some
there were still the counts games of whist and boston at which
there were the foul air and the dust
there were then as now conversations and discussions about womens
there were three operating tables in the tent two were occupied
there were two of them one was an officer a tall soldierly
there were very many of these as one could easily believe
there what did i say said alpatych coming into his own again
there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a
there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow theres the
there will be a council of war at kutuzovs tonight though you
there will be no more war old womens nonsense old womens
there with quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking
there would be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and
there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael
there wouldnt have been nothing left of him i tell you surely
there you see and he drew attention to the bullets whistling
there you see how strangely fate has brought us together said
there you see mon cher i expect you know that messrs
thereby became still more attractive to them returning from the yard
thereby inviting prince andrew to come too he did so
thereby offended
thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had
therefore could not serve as material for science
therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive
therefore most terrible thoughts would give him no peace he knew
therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count
therefore to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear
therefore variously interpreted the life of old prince bolkonski
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the
therein should already have suggested to your heart if it is sincere
therell hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as
theres a child in that house havent you seen a child cried
theres no need for you to go at all said denisov addressing
theres no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry
theres not half of it left yes i told you the whole quarter beyond

theres nothing to be done well have to wake him said

these
these actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the
these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had
these are the steppes of asia its a nasty country all the same au
these away put this on the seat and this to the right
these battalions went away the guns would remain without support
these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield with their queer
these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the
these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an
these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some
these circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that
these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict
these conditions of life had been the same before but then they
these different people businessmen relations and acquaintances
these difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone
these dispositions of which the french historians write with
these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one
these establishments in large letters this establishment is
these events and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional
these events then listen
these exclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the
these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and
these first days before the eighth of september when the
these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission the eyes
these gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white
these gigantic men and horses had it not occurred to rostov to
these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean while the grand
these good gifts are you content with yourself and with your life
these guests the famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with
these he spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he
these historians also see and admit historical events which are
these historians not as the results of free transferences of the
these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some
these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each
these jesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew
these justifications release those who produce the events from moral
these ladies and all these civilities said he aloud in sonyas
these means by an act worthy of himself and of the french army he let
these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her
these men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of
these men only brothers and burned with impatience to set to work
these new affairs prince vasili had to settle matters with pierre
these people from a courtiers point of view and in an emperors
these people he pointed to the peasants asks you to come up to the
these people lagged behind himself who never left the country in
these people were placed and more free to one who does not know
these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such
these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of sound of
these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these
these questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents
these questions like questions put at trials generally left the
these questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing
these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a
these rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past
these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of
these tastes and he was incapable of considering what the
these terrible recollections prince vasili sighed yes yes my
these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of
these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores the
these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which
these visits of natashas at night before the count returned from
these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme totally
these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest they
they again became disorganized many were drowned and many
they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher
they all felt it to be so
they all felt that there was no more to be said
they all find place in her but she was very happy as they were
they all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was
they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against
they all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness
they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who
they all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into
they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii
they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage and
they all seemed to him equally meaningless
they all seemed very gay
they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as
they all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange longhaired
they all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his
they all went without knowing whither or why they were going
they always said having a good time well im glad of it
they always will forget everything said the countess dont
they and he heard those people anatole and dolokhov shouting and
they are beaten flogged or sent to siberia i dont suppose they are
they are bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of
they are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
they are only concerned with their own petty interests
they are quite different that must be true really he is quite unlike
they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the
they are repulsed everywhere for which i thank god and our brave
they are talking about us about me and him thought natasha and
they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the
they are very clear and certain i write all this to you dear friend
they are waiting for their younger son pierre replied he joined
they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle and then
they asked the old man what are you being punished for daddy i
they attack our center we having the center battery on this high
they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them
they avoided looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant
they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well
they both knew had moved with her cubs to the otradnoe copse a small
they both sat silent with an occasional glance at one another
they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and
they brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner and the
they called the room for the hunt servants
they came upon some dozens of soldiers continually replaced by
they can reply to historys essential question what is power the
they can still be called back said one of his suite who like
they cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to
they cant do anything always make some muddle he muttered
they cant have wanted to kill me but at the same time his left
they cant hold all that line its impossible i will undertake to
they cant understand that all those feelings they prize so all our
they coax me as if i were vaska the cat said denisov jokingly
they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that
they could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order
they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year
they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later
they described the activity of individuals who ruled the people and
they desire to serve not sparing their lives and it is not any
they did all they could to destroy themselves from the time they
they did catch me theyd string me up to an aspen tree and with all
they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh
they did not drag her away at once but sang with her for a long
they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or
they dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed
they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as if they
they do the guns
they dont even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov
they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and
they entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and
they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining
they entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to
they even say remarked the man of great merit who did not yet
they feel themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was
they fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some
they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to
they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking
they gave that the story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the
they give little hope replied the prince
they glanced at one another hardly able to suppress their laughter
they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence
they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they
they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and
they had been trying first one remedy and then another worn out by
they had come to some understanding he replied from no one i
they had decided to be at the ball by half past ten and natasha had
they had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the
they had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled head
they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when
they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something
they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too
they had taken those first steps both had changed greatly since
they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the
they happened to be by themselves but merely gazed at her natasha
they have been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been
they have behaved
they have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper
they have come to said he pointing to the prisoners worse off
they have gone away sir went away yesterday at vespertime
they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency
they have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been
they have yielded up all europe to him and have now come to teach us
they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they
they impose on the people he repeated
they in pierres mind were the soldiers those who had been at the
they insisted on her coming with me
they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they mean to
they killed him almost before my eyes
they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her that it would soon
they knew anything of the 6th regiment none of them knew anything
they knew ought to be talked over at length at last the
they knew their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she
they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at
they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had
they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he
they march splendidly remarked someone in bagrations suite
they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the
they may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but
they may he says they may whispered natasha
they meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they
they might be laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the
they might be up to on the sly she meant that they would be
they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous
they might call a halt here or well have to do another four
they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day each
they must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers
they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive
they named the colonel prince repnin
they never took their eyes off the couple in the intervals of the
they now seemed to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the
they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet dolokhov
they ought all to be happy
they passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in
they probably recognized that i am french by my name replied
they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to
they probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes
they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they
they reached the frontier
they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
they received pierre in their small new drawingroom where it
they regard smolensk as the place where they hope to recover during
they respected and even feared him
they retired he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even
they rode at a footpace to the barn where a large crowd of peasants
they rode close by continuing to converse and prince andrew
they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french
they rode up the opposite hill from there the french could
they rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which
they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those
they sang their soldiers dance song
they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had
they saw in him only no 17 of the captured russians arrested and
they saw only barbarism ignorance or evil intention in every
they saw the french
they say
they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist
they say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina
they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing
they say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is
they seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and
they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone
they seized him with special force no matter what he thought about
they seized makar alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the
they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope
they settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you
they shall too if only
they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her
they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man
they shut the door and all sat down
they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner
they split up the wood pressed it down on the fire blew at it with
they spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of
they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free
they still held their ground
they still living he asked
they stoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall
they stood silent facing one another the old mans sharp eyes were
they stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and hows
they surrendered dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya who lay
they surrounded ramballe lifted him on the crossed arms of two
they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied
they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old
they themselves were in of giving way to the pity they felt for the
they then crossed the hollow to semenovsk where the soldiers were
they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and
they thought yet greater riches might be found and moscow engulfed
they to do with raevskis tender paternal feelings when their own
they told her that all moscow has been burned down and that
they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and
they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from
they waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day
they walked about and talked attached themselves to someone
they want more croaked napoleon frowning let them have it
they want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice
they want the whole nation to fall on them in a word its moscow
they want to make an end of it
they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall
they wanted of him he heard what they said but did not understand
they went away because for russians there could be no question as to
they went into the little room where boris slept rostov without
they went into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian
they went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the
they went out only young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles
they went through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant
they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the
they were again silent
they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of
they were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of
they were always the same but most of all he liked to hear
they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be
they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth
they were both frenchmen with a frightened and suffering look
they were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth
they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man
they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one

think of her the real truth because you know andrew is risking so
think of him not think of him but forget him quite forget him for

think what she would say she said this cant go on it wont you
think what you please i know you are just like father think as
think you were talking of the schon grabern affair were you there
thinkers but has never been denied they do not see that the role
thinking about her at all anatole was not quickwitted nor ready
thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was
thinking about you why are you going
thinking and the pretext for that was a game of patience when she
thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
thinking i go to bed after two in the morning thoughts come and i
thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowing if he didnt he
thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from

thinking of eh
thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be
thinking of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement
thinking of nothing

third count arakcheev if his nerves were not too weak
third day there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was
third house in the village of gorki
third report shook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed
third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices
third was a domestic serf about fortyfive years old with grizzled

thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own
thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must

thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general
thirty dogs and twenty horsemen
thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort instead of staining
thirty said he looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful
thirtyeight guns were taken on the spot besides standards and
thirtyfive feet long an seven feet high moved forward along the
thirtyfive hours and beat him but he would not hold out even for
thirtysecond military division of bremen of hamburg and so on
this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear
this agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you
this aim in one of her talks with her father confessor she
this aim was that of christianity itself it taught men to be wise and
this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
this and a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present in
this and even more trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around
this and suddenly princess mary will tell her and she will be sure
this answered nicholas you say it rests with me well i
this as if at a command everyone began to run
this battery when two balls and then four more fell among our
this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron
this being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally
this blackeyed widemouthed girl not pretty but full of life
this boy during that conversation and remembering all he had said
this buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he
this burst into the room he opened the casement the night was
this but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form
this but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at the
this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which
this caused some delay at the doors but after all he did at last
this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely
this conception is the one handle by means of which the material
this confusion division and the unpopularity of the foreign
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders
this consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from
this contradiction arises from the fact that military science
this cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur
this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path
this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof was so constructed
this disorder he muttered do as you like
this disposition on the left flank increased pierres doubt of his own
this door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of the
this drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing
this enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing
this engagement never was much to my liking of course he is an
this excitement might have on her son she went several times to his
this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the
this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the
this fact impressed alpatych but in thinking about his own business
this family gathering seemed humiliating to natasha as if there
this feeling from others and even from herself the stronger it
this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was
this first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in
this fresh calamity remember that you have still to answer to our
this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to
this general hating barclay rode to visit a friend of his own a
this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized
this goal is the greatness of the roman spanish or french realm
this habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling
this had been prepared by innumerable socalled chances in his life
this he could not help being aware it just as we cannot renew an
this he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was
this heart so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so
this hell soon have us too for his subjects how are you and he
this helpless little creature but dared not do so he stood over him
this holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to
this holiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be loved
this honor
this house and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as i
this ideal of glory and grandeur which consists not merely in
this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like
this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove
this involuntarily came closer to him
this involuntarily rostov recalled all the good he had heard about
this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince
this is absurd come let go i tell you
this is all very fine but things must be settled said prince
this is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humble
this is dolokhov said prince andrew
this is for boris from me for his outfit
this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and
this is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and ill
this is my niece said the count introducing sonya you dont
this is not at all the thing he said what sort of polish
this is outrageous half the men have dispersed
this is right on the other side
this is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly
this is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is
this is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the
this is what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love
this is what the army authorities were reporting
this is what they have done with russia this is what they have
this is what what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances
this is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the
this junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of
this kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he
this lad he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for
this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the
this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when
this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a
this letter was brought to pierres house when he was on the field
this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow
this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that
this man bent double rushed past the tradesman and the officer
this man he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i
this man is still needed to justify the final collective act
this man now has influence i must gain his confidence and friendship
this may be my only chance of seeing the emperor it wont be long now
this meant that tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he
this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to
this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing herself did not

this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when
this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not
this moment pierre was supported in his design and prevented from
this movement might lead to weyrother had been twice that evening
this object offered a three days truce on condition that both
this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct
this obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently
this occurs and i talk of genius
this of them they could not forget that situated as she was while
this officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make
this old man living alone in the country for so many years could
this one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed
this one wouldnt hurt a fly she has asked me to bring you two

this physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an
this plan perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a
this plan some of them attribute to pfuel others to a certain
this polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and
this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly
this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life
this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to
this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that
this procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time
this prophecy pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what
this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and
this question observed
this reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked
this red borzoi natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly
this redhaired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being
this redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which
this reinforcement
this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what
this relation of the men who command to those they command is what
this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was
this reply of balashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of
this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army
this same kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief
this scrap of earth but have lived and shall live forever there
this second blow restored natasha to life
this short man had on a white leather apron which covered his
this silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to
this small house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting
this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange
this speech not only made a strong impression but created
this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of
this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the
this station but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it
this strange she look about with pleasure smiling joyfully
this stranger
this stranger the trouble but the mason told him that was not
this that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was
this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of
this the remarks of all except pfuel had one common trait that had
this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that
this they are all suffering as i am who then is it who flashed
this tightlaced purplefaced general wait respectfully while captain
this time
this time nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough
this to his daughter but natasha noticed her fathers nervousness and
this to the princess alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the
this to you he added turning to natasha
this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary
this unknown factor the spirit of an army is a problem for science
this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy
this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom
this very ram swelling with fat is killed for meat
this very sentence about countess zubova and this same laugh
this view was very general in the upper army circles and found
this vortex of intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings
this was done by the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in
this was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could
this was kuragin whom she could not help watching as they were
this was particularly noticeable on nesvitskis usually laughing
this was quite correct on the twentyfourth of july but on the

this was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied
this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and
this way uncle cried the girl well pass through the side
this way your excellency where are you going this way
this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and
this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way
this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he

those leaders
those meetings and how sedulously and promptly all that related to

those nearest and dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying
those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed
those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the
those of a man living in solitude and seclusion
those of a merry peasant dance began to sound all the doorways of

those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most
those were horses balaga continued the tale that time id

those who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god
those who hated her she remembered anatole who had done her so much

thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a
thought as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to

thought berg this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself
thought but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to

thought he and he turned round and galloped back to the place where
thought he called tikhon and began to undress
thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy
thought he had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are
thought he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there
thought he to himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would
thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when
thought how he would impress boris and all his comrades of the

thought i should have said even if he had to go on dying to die

thought in his mind at that time was who was it that had really
thought is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment
thought looking at savelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he
thought must not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should
thought nicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange

to avoid her look she felt strange and awkward
to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful he is not received
to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but to take up only
to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and
to avoid thinking about his wife and about natasha and prince andrew
to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural
to bald hills and the recent news of his fathers death and had
to be a man
to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep
to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only
to be animated by the same desire

to be talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lovely
to be to unload the muskets muskets explode the ammunition and
to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart and
to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet
to be unfair
to be whipped as soon as napoleons interpreter had spoken says
to be worthy of it this rescript began with the words sergey
to bearing with his fathers peculiarities and partly because he
to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment of
to believe in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole
to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in
to believe the exhausted wavering men felt comforted and inspirited
to betray his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant
to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many
to blame all round well what else do you want
to blame all that he had been specially put in charge of the state
to blame because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed
to blame with his dimple and blue eyes and how frightened he was he
to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief to illustrate the theory
to bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and
to boris julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early

to come to see her
to come to wake natasha at three in the morning but generally found
to comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone
to conceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her
to concentrate all the artillery in the center and secondly to
to consider them to be anything but like other men and we shall not

to cry or to laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and
to cry sobbing like a child the door opened the doctor with his
to cry the tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few
to cut off an army to bar its road is quite impossible for there is
to cut them off and capture them all
to cutting off a leg or an arm for me
to defend moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the
to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander
to destroy his army the most skillful strategist could hardly have
to devote to his service and chair a canon we are ready to make of
to different people

to do it because you married her answered an inner voice
to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he
to do that i think there were not many such gallant sons of the
to do the best he could he thought out everything and that is why he

to drive them out of russia minimizing as far as possible the
to drop it
to dumfound people and impel them to insane selfoblivion he called
to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my
to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be
to endure war is the most difficult subordination of mans
to ensure freedom of sale for them 1 from today peasants
to enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them
to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as
to enter that room
to enter the brotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorship
to enter there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of
to erect in his own garden to his memory and he told everybody that
to err is human
to escape it all and felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him
to every other evening party with its talk tea and lighted candles
to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia with
to expiate his huntsmans offense ilagin pressed the rostovs to
to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first
to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign he explained
to express it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting
to express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that

to fall for a whole day or a whole month or go on falling and never
to feel as if there were nothing more to come nothing that
to feel herself terribly near to this man when she turned away she
to feel that in this world theres one

to get him a peasants coat and a pistol confiding to him his
to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she
to get out of moscow minutely explained to him his whole policy and
to get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and
to give formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with
to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge this
to give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have
to glance at him

to go a greater distance than they had already traversed before
to go and find out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that
to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we
to god for their victory over the french on the fourteenth of june
to gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and
to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or religion

to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
to handle him you know the story of the handkerchief it is
to happen and my heart tells me it will
to happen everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how is
to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the

to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible
to have been broken into wished to force their way in too and a fight
to have grown thicker round sonya and natasha as the air does before a
to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the
to have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it
to have something to say in her salon and secretaries of the embassy
to head off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still
to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes
to heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it
to helenes her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but
to help feeling sad moscow shes the mother of cities how can one

to her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to

to her son asking him to take it to its destination and make use of
to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open
to her table in the sitting room
to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing
to her that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sad
to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was
to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it
to her to be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should

to her with exaggerated politeness
to her with her better spirits
to herself kept looking round toward the drawingroom door it opened
to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out
to him a pathetic kindly old man much to be pitied
to him about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising
to him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and
to him almost every night he opened his eyes as they were closing
to him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he
to him and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box
to him and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the
to him and he had not once been to see the rostovs since the day of
to him and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so
to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to
to him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to
to him at the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital
to him by his female relations was repugnant to him the other way
to him essential and the second aim that of purifying and
to him except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a
to him for it nothing good on pierres part seemed to her to be an
to him from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the
to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen
to him he liked petersburg and despised moscow the remembrance of
to him jabbering fine isnt it its all the frenchy can do to
to him more please more whats he saying
to him pierre got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the
to him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable
to him someone obligingly took the dish from bagration or he
to him such a small insignificant creature compared with what was
to him that everyone regarded the italian in the same light and he
to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not
to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive
to him to cross to the kaluga road but just then an adjutant
to him too her face seemed to say ah what have you done to me
to him very important and so he thought it necessary to take an

to him which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is
to him which was that it had been impossible to fight before
to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war
to him why tell me you must tell me
to him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he
to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile
to him with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary
to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed
to him with the same feelings all their faces were now shining
to himself it was around him that the people chiefly crowded
to himself passing in review the principal pictures of the magic
to himself that natasha attracted him just as much as ever but that
to his feet
to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him
to his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the
to his honor baron asch from generalinchief prince bolkonski
to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh
to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have
to his mental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he
to his mind
to his own
to his portrait definitely demanded that he should be called
to his room
to his serene highness a matter of great importance for their
to his side with his face to the wall he sighed
to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he
to his sister was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to
to his throat im galloping to the commander of the corps how do
to his wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people
to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended
to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
to imbibe he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impure
to indicate he did not want more tea
to inform you but dont be uneasy he added noticing that the
to insist
to intervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows
to italy his opponents reluctance to fight and his own childish
to join petya or to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg
to justify herself you have not understood me nikolenka it is your
to kiss and would say till tomorrow or be in to dinner or i
to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of
to kiss for him dear sonya whom he loved and thought of just the
to know it and i talk about chance i see a force producing effects

to learned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander
to leave at his death and which he called his will
to leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly
to left for some time he sighed and looked down
to let go please sir pleaded gerasim trying carefully to
to listen to his tale
to little natasha you reproach us women with being illogical here
to live hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm
to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the
to live this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that
to longcoat which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and
to look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak
to look into the matter can easily convince himself
to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him in the next
to mademoiselle bourienne i embrace you as i love you
to major ekonomov he could not help taking notice of the soldier
to make a mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was
to make an adroit thrust en prime and so on the cudgel of the
to make as successful a career of it as possible
to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer
to make it right prince andrews voice trembled and he turned away
to make something exceptional of them said the visitor

to other manifestations of life and so it is with the purpose of

to pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at
to pierre glancing at him again
to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic
to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is
to pierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice of
to pierres words more than once when the noise of the wheels

to prince murat
to prince vasili and answering his imploring look yes or no
to prince vasili he was so kind he at once agreed to

to question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by
to raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men
to reaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was
to read and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me
to read princess marys letter
to read when i am gone you will find them useful
to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only
to receive the guests and the visitors
to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love
to refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it
to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no
to remain at bald hills might be dangerous he respectfully advised
to remain but ordered the venerable old postmaster klyucharev to be
to remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed
to remember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of
to replace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able
to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him which constantly

to rule just the same as now i ask you count who will be
to run talking firing into the air and disobeying orders the moral
to rustchuk but i only employed these two things and took more
to say
to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation
to say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza and
to say in nicholas house the young countess bezukhova was not often
to say something but could not her brother had guessed right the
to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the
to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and his
to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so
to say that as he does not understand its use he does not believe in
to say to the tsar or to kutuzov even if they were alive and
to say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult
to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman

to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think but
to see the governor by his excellencys order answered

to settle here altogether next year
to settle the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry
to several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered
to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but
to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples
to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and
to shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a
to shout at them but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair

to sleep but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
to sleep princess mary thought about this for a long time and at last
to slip in over there

we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we
we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare
we knew youd say so but it wont do because you see if you say

we occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round

we ought to go dont you think so said nicholas come to me
we ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today
we ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that
we put them into the wing the mens room or the nurses room we

wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled and suffered and
wealthy city being given over to destruction for a great city with
wealthy deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies as
wealthy man he was very exposed produced in him a state of
weapons to the drunken rabble now had processions displaying the
wear a red ribbon round the left arm
weariness
weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask
wearing a cross round his neck approached the speaker
wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily
wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap
wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt ferapontov was standing
wearing spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress
wearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery in
wearing the white horse guards cap and a military overcoat with a
wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and
weary of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always
weather are not bound together he thought repeating words of
weather had cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet

weighed every word in it to the best of his ability
weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for
weight and he raised his hand to his white horse guards cap with a
weight his white head twitched with the effort at last he rose
weight of the hanging body and how the workman sat down his head
weight they were carrying were too much for them
weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but
welcomed by his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back
welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their

welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him
