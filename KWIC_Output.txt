a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips with
a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the friend
a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am in
a moment and evidently understanding what rostov hinted thought
a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things for
a moment he felt it necessary to hold his head higher to only
a moment ill fetch it said mademoiselle bourienne and she wait
a moment ill get my work now then what are you thinking wait
a moment ill light a candle you damned rascal where do you wait

a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush for
a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and in
a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song at
a moment with a sinking heart and then immediately starting to for
a moments silence natasha answered yes ill after
a month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were him
a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half within
a month had recently died in the rostovs house at yaroslavl and than
a month passed in quiet surroundings she felt more and more after
a more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov by
a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so assumed
a mournful expression with
a municipality was established and the following constitution
a musical phrase that particularly pleased her she listened sang

a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the with
a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was left
a notion that medicine ever cured anyone killed them yes said what
a notorious duelist and rake and every now and then he other
a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to hold
a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of a certain prince he with
a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd with
a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected with
a panic in
a paper from his writing table here and he handed it to taking
a paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had showed
a paper that lay before him did not look up without consulting
a particularly kindly attention yes i heard said he with
a pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had was

a victim something on which to vent his rage desired
a victory and at once without leaving the church thanks were been
a vise round his sons neck and without a word he began to sob like

action cruel
action did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the the
action especially to an attack but when they had marched for into
action from dolgorukov he felt that kutuzov was upset and coming
action had begun on the right flank and the french were already the
action in which at least half of them would be left on the field an
action into action bring him a bottle for such news but how into
action resultant
action that a criminal was reared among male factors original
action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear this

actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where human
actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the these
actions his
actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed the

activities of 160000 russians and french all their passions human
activity
activity and guide him in planning his future actions just present
activity and the movement of peoples and in no case intellectual
activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as his
activity in which no one could be justified or guilty a spiritual
activity nor even by a combination of the two as intellectual
activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful the
activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws personal
activity regularity in his household was carried to facilitating
activity was directed toward restraining his troops by kutuzovs
activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very bolkonskis
activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres increased
actors and actresses were robbed the
actors of 1812 have long since left the stage their personal the
acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs man
acts which it is difficult to justify other

all find place in her but she was very happy as they were they
all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte not
all foreigners from moscow and that there had been some spies even
all gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters were
all go were not germans well
all gods scourge said dron what horses we had have been its
all gone so why she says dont we go and he began are
all got done as if of its own accord toward night candles were it
all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was they
all had been ready but they still delayed and all were minutes
all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against they
all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking we
all he added in a tone of command you
all he asked himself no not to unite thoughts cannot be unite
all he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribe
all he said that it was necessary to await provisions or that and
all he said to me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear at
all he said was so prettily sedate and the naivete of his but
all he thought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea was
all her acquaintances not only cordially but even with a shade by
all her attention he seemed to her kind brave absorbed
all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would left
all her faculties princess mary looked at him the comic straining
all her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring day
all her witchery of which her singing had been an unusually abandoned
all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again account
all his decisions and intentions he went to kuragins nullifying
all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with the with
all his property not to us his direct heirs but to pierre left
all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the were
all human capabilities as well these men though enchanted with but
all i can make out is that everything is abominable well
all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not something
all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear goodby thats
all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the no
all impossible to express all one thinks and that he had after
all is neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and purity
all kinds of woes and the end of the world in pierre portend
all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness they
all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less by
all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband at
all like children of my own as you know you
all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the face
all looked excited and worried faces
all looked smart and well kept horses
all looking at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed were
all lost your wits or i have outlived mine may god help you have
all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the evidently
all maintained a solemn silence listening to the words kuragins
all meet at the karagins please come no really eh said shall
all men are equals and had more than once impressed on his that
all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life pierre
all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked like
all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got a from
all napoleons attempts at conciliation were discussed in that and
all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he and
all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water ground
all night had not yet come home when rostov rode back early cards
all night he glanced at prince andrew and did not even nod to slept
all nonsense all rubbish those discussions which lead to its
all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices its
all not managed to present at the right moment though she had after
all on the twentyfourth of august at shevardino and on the of
all other considerations out
all our hearts you ravish quite the emperor passed on elisaveta
all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorovski and young
all over but i am a coward yes a coward thought rostov its
all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it bespattered
all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as was sire
all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who they
all poetry and old wives talk all that doing good to ones thats
all previous wars she did not realize the significance of this like
all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for above
all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into they
all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii they
all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road halted
all right all right well
all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a its
all right no one thinks you a coward but thats not the thats
all right thanks you can go well
all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805 they its
all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fight if
all sat waiting silently and alert in the outlying serfs hall
all saw pierre or someone extraordinarily like him in a rostovs
all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage and they
all seemed to him equally meaningless they
all seemed very gay they
all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as they
all she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous say
all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences on
all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces who on
all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry from
all silent the glow spread rising and failing farther and were
all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange longhaired they
all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his they
all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry immediately
all talk of their present situation avoided
all that day but had heard about them from an infantry hussars
all that evening and next day reports came in one after but
all that follows therefrom and
all that had been so humiliating in her mornings visit remembered
all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally and that
all that is only lifes setting the real thing is love but
all that matter in comparison with the will of god without could
all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and after
all that time talked in low tones of other matters deliberations
all that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom preserved
all that was in anisya and in anisyas father and mother understand
all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by represented
all that was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for for
all thats left me and at the same time he said in a thats
all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph of
all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of the that
all the cause of this is my egotism i set myself above him and so at
all the circumstances concluded that the battle was lost and weighed
all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of
all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life of
all the commanders and then that happy moment that toulon for of
all the departments of government in
all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of herself
all the facts of history as far as we know it confirm millions
all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theres its
all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line a of
all the french will be here any day now so what are we waiting above
all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which rearguard
all the generals officers and soldiers of the french army knew done
all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment almost
all the historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the which
all the holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and remove
all the known participants but with a more remote event we already of
all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and and
all the officers appeared to be and really were in love nails
all the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone employed
all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary to
all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him like
all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess and
all the places he meant to go to and where he had been visiting
all the possible directions because in it there were fewest of
all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to bore
all the regiment knew for a rogue whom
all the russians of that day desired to drive the french out what
all the same but
all the same continued dmitrievna if they hear of thats
all the same never be like those petersburg young men will
all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to its
all the same she thought and did not reply not
all the same that night natasha now agitated and now but
all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a its
all the same to me he said i only want to see whether its
all the same to me when my sons fate is at stake the really
all the same without my friends and he expects me not to alone
all the same you must refuse him well
all the soldiers turned toward the women and while the vehicle was of
all the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with order
all the time me
all the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking against
all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided marched
all the wellknown people of that period from alexander and reaction
all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs from
all the worlds capitals we are feared but we are warsaw
all their experience of previous battles when after one tenth after
all their strength and held back the crowd that was pushing with
all them

and again blended now into solemn church music now into separate
and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had her
and again glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old whistled
and again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread eternity
and again relapsed into her radiant smile face
and again repeated his longdrawn cry atu this call and aloft
and again rose and bounded forward followed at the distance of teeth
and again she began to sob my child my dear one lord
and again soldiers straggling from their companies something
and again went up to the cot drops
and against that project ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed for
and agitated natasha ran into the drawing room pale
and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the curiosity
and agreeable remark except to pierre and helene whose careless
and aidesdecamp berthier his chief of staff dropped behind pages
and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting irresolution
and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and surprised
and alert entering potemkins gaily colored tent and a vigorous
and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking inquisitively
and alexander with all their antecedents napoleon
and all about his relations and his financial and family manhood
and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil awakening
and all at once she felt cheerful whats the good of making so away
and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere someone
and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and he
and all humanity goodness
and all made ready for that battle the cries from the sanguinary
and all of you only vera and what for what have i done to much
and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the trouble
and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken cart
and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors the cutlets
and all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty taken
and all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova denisov well
and all this is not right its not right you may take fellow
and all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very nothing
and all were trying to calm one another done
and all you have been doing on your estates travels
and allowing the french to pass him had made a woodcutting
and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natasha alone yet the sorry
and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that it
and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a sole
and also that murats mistake would very soon be discovered pass
and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he ones
and also very few domestic or literate serfs and in neighborhood
and always brought back french clothing and weapons and when booty
and always shall be independent but to go against his will and been
and am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostov here
and am fit for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic nothing
and am going to rejoin my regiment i am giving a farewell of
and am sure that all due respect would be shown you and
and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev moderate
and among them at the rostovs with whom he had renewed before
and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and decrees
and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up head
and an ax stuck in his girdle when he espied denisov he shoulder
and an emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in right
and an escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and marshals
and an infinite series of causes time
and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder halt
and andrew i shall be so happy when she is his wife she is so father
and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and shame
and angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do frightened
and angry words reproaches
and animated natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement bright
and anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him for
and announced that she was going to see prince nicholas calls
and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable surprise
and another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out voice
and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle asked
and answers were heard the publican taking advantage questions
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one sleeplessness
and anxiety to the court circle of which anna unpleasantness
and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider hoofs
and appealing smile and took his hand that he might ingratiating
and are expecting him every day the count wanted to leave regiment
and are you still true to boris he continued well
and arm breeches
and around another instant and i shall never again see the me
and around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on before
and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs visitors
and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety shame
and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of russia
and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their order
and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among different
and as denisov expressed it were sharpening their teeth for convoy
and as far as was in his power held the troops back he did will
and as for him i wont let him go on any account dolokhov
and as he did subsequently in 1813 his activity at that previously
and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the drinking
and as he went on became more and more animated he told them of it
and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was say
and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had herself
and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed drawn
and as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend persistently
and as the connection of the people with the rulers civilization
and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not gridneva
and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse tools
and as up to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had moscow
and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word confess
and ask him i does that satisfy you go
and asked how much he owed packages
and asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied french
and asked if she felt rested after their journey she answered hair
and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there threshold
and asking them all to be seated began attend
and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did caught
and assumed a serious expression arms
and assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was her
and at ease an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we idle
and at every moment of this continuous uninterrupted itself
and at every word he added but dont hurt my little horse there
and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at him side
and at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the him
and at his shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him him
and at last on the first of september when the army drew march
and at last succeeded in making them believe her her first her
and at once went to meet the major officer
and at that moment afforded him pleasure the enemys guns brain
and at that moment though the day was still a light approaching
and at the grand balls was divided into several circles each court
and at the head of a regiment he fell as a hero worthy of his hand
and at the people in it round a long table covered with black room
and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero troops
and at the same time he began to be conscious of the accomplished
and at the same time pacify the mob criminal
and at the very instant he died having made an effort he asleep
and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him sorrowful
and attending to her nephews education she was sad now people
and attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in dismal
and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a silently
and austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed russia
and avoided giving battle action
and avoiding their eyes girls
and awkward as were all the words he spoke that day and disjointed
and awkwardness on his part in her presence embarrassment
and back and back again and again in an instant rostovs
and back distracted him all he saw about him merged into a stomach
and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing front
and bad harvests or of the necessity of rebuilding factories fires
and bade him lie down saying that he must prostrate himself angles

and barclay advised what would have happened had the french bennigsen
and be essential for its purposes but in its jurisprudence
and be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that it
and bearing a bootmakers signboard stood a score of thin shutters
and beautiful as in reality and even more so because it was light
and became weaker every day princess mary hoped she prayed for less
and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name young
and because his voice shook when he said what they have proverbs
and because they friends from childhood had to think kindhearted
and because you yourself dont love him relation

and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them censer
and by austerlitz and tilsit and erfurt him
and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be killed
and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one grief
and by his correspondence with kurbski terrible
and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the death
and by the embarrassed faces of sonya and marya distress
and by the reports of the guerrillas kutuzov was almost sure sent
and by the throat with the other the officer dropping his hand
and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not attempt
and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that officer
and called berthier back
and called to his orderly down

and changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank niemen
and changing the subject kutuzov began to speak of the turkish send
and charged murat to find kutuzov then he gave careful roads
and charm of his friendship with prince andrew that charm strength
and checking the enemys advance and by this effort to unite battle
and cheerful calm
and chiefly it was impossible because never since the fourthly

and civil authorities and your tears will soon cease to military
and civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of officers
and clapping rostov on the shoulder with his big hand round
and cleared his throat and at that moment little andrew shouted moved
and clearly through his mind only once in my life to get rapidly
and clever that it was evident that he was old and stupid complicated
and closed the door himself behind him him
and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage repugnance
and clothes over his arm to see whether he would not start a hands
and coaches for themselves the few inhabitants who had caleches

and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far strength
and complicated and he replied to his mother in cold difficult
and comprehensible path but hoped to do so straight
and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek say
and condemned as unsuitable from every point of view the barclay
and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored wealth
and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when fight
and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened anatole
and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the frenchmen
and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run fascinating
and consolidated at borodino a collision took place increased
and constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not awkwardness
and contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all firm
and contentedly galloped along the roads of poland without gaily
and continued her chatter him
and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic unexpectedly
and conversing with those in the highest spheres dealing
and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the seen

and curly blueblack hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a eyes
and cut up by roughshod hoofs the marks of which were runners
and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and swords
and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in stockings
and dandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the babys palm

and deep dip making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to steep
and defeats for kutuzov napoleon
and definitely understood without any sense of clearly
and delight would find in his wifes ideas and actions the surprise
and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take direction
and denisov drove away with the wounded dolokhov rostov
and denisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers bolkonski
and denisov were walking up and down looking with kindly nicholas
and denisovs unable to make out what it all meant esauls
and desires and the impulses felt by a single person are always hopes
and desires doubts selfreproach and hopes reawoke destroyed

and did not once mount a horse to inspect his weeks
and did not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling head

and discussed together with the latest of vasili lvovich read
and disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion health
and dishes and arranged them on the table when she had doeuvres
and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not regret
and dislike of kutuzov disapproval
and disrespectfully at kozlovski angrily
and dissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the idle
and dissolved into nothingness altogether
and distrust but the expression on all the faces was apprehension
and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who not
and dohkturov noted them down complied
and doing so groaned involuntarily sighed
and dolokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and anatole
and dolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of hundred
and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him
and dolokhov went along the pavement when they reached the anatole
and dont know how to equip boris she took out her penny
and down the room for a long time no longer piercing an up
and drawing itself out and pitipitipiti and titi stretching
and drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it sofa

and dropped but he did not look at them he looked only at groaned
and dropping her eyes blushing
and drought had continued for more than three weeks each day heat
and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were pillars
and drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of dissatisfied
and dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a you
and during his stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to her
and during the two days of the young mans visit he was account
and easily forgets himself and other people a russian is excitable
and eat something have a drink dolokhov shouted to him from come
and educational institutions under her patronage had given charitable
and effort and yet during his whole reign never once attempted time
and elevate me but you dont understand it purify
and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had dangerous
and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended camp
and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but tenderness
and energetic he remarked when he had read over the short
and enfeebled bennigsen the tsarevich and a swarm of confused
and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation smile
and entered his shop on seeing the soldiers he was about returned
and entering the house occupied by kutuzov asked for olmutz
and entertaining after the field marshals departure it interesting
and enthusiasm natasha with a quiet happy smile selfsatisfaction
and enthusiasm was only the loss of the battle of austerlitz fear
and entreaties soon after anna pavlovnas reception anna endeavors
and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than chosen
and envy of anothers health rostov went to the middle of reproach
and equality have people since the revolution become happier liberty
and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at liberty
and ermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke konovnitsyn
and especially by the sound of the bullets ride
and especially kutuzov for having failed to do so another
and especially since he had joined the active army and commission
and even a little themselves and it was on this that the shouting
and even advantageously as long as no one asks what is the anyone
and even fought with other companies for them before they quarreled
and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to alexander
and even in his very smell and he looked at the man without corner
and even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence the bourienne
and even marry her rostov thought but just now there were so now
and even more trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around this
and even phrases prince andrew came up stroked her reminiscences
and even rude to him he became silent and i recollected unpleasant
and even the frenchmen in the russian service could do french
and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov but despised learning
and even their faces more and more distinctly they were our figures
and even tomorrow replied her brother yes
and even with disgust of that natasha who had just passed him contempt
and everincreasing crowds were running back to where confused
and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely reappeared
and everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being bared
and everything that they did not want or could not carry away tubs
and everywhere sides
and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he himself
and evidently submitting to him involuntarily attention
and evidently understood balashevs importance he led him past polite
and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear to see the him
and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembled september
and exceptional position when anything particularly peculiar
and excited italian oblivious of decorum followed him and flushed
and exclusively this was a plan of campaign he had passionately
and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds pleasurable
and exiled for no particular offense now assembled the arrested
and expectations to the contrary which were current then but hints
and exploding them detonators
and express his thoughts like that when awake think
and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary to understanding
and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved shoulders
and faded outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg sunken
and fall as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the dead
and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed pretense
and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities strange
and farther i feel that i cannot vanish since nothing farther
and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and mysterious
and fat little petya doubled up with laughter sonya
and fear only recently talking with one of platovs contempt
and fear that showed itself on prince vasilis face confusion
and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark starry night battle
and feeling the hand of god upon him suddenly recognizes mission
and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work step
and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain aims
and fell on his hands the others outstripped him stumbled
and felt a joyful sense of comfort regeneration and believe
and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke everything
and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew still anxiety
and felt sorry for her and for himself and in a nervously pregnancy
and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed
and felt their feelings what they would have said and what thoughts
and fencing from the village benches
and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some yard
and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive horses
and fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with shouting
and figure of prince andrew in a fur cloak the deep collar of face
and finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to urgently
and fireworks are becoming wearisome festivities
and fireworks at zakret count bennigsens country seat regatta
and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this intently
and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed but outside
and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle knapsack
and flattering manner they were all evidently firmly friendly
and flew out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that mouth
and flew to her up
and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone shoulders
and flourishing his arm called him to enter something
and flourishing the whip side
and flows rapidly imperceptibly and irrepressibly as surely
and flushed she paced the room sending now for michael agitated
and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly natasha
and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff grades
and foolish in helenes presence as a lover should be excited
and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to coachmen
and for her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and them
and for many other reasons the fact is that other militia
and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg yes
and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later ferocity
and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes fellow
and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction good
and forecasts as to the further progress of the war in this drawn
and foresees the adversarys intentions contingencies
and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down the fields
and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see brother
and forgiveness of injuries and that men attribute the love
and forgot where she was going and with whom having fallen into love
and forming up one word from me one movement of my approaching
and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the milldam
and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole autumn
and found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing room
and four dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot wounded
and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first thirteen
and free from dependence on cause time
and freedom now that he was deprived of all this seemed cleanliness
and french colors draped from side to side of the streets russian
and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables russian
and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables russian
and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show eyes
and freshness of the pond he longed to get into that water ooze
and friendships he is a man who has been more than a attachments
and frivolous the military calling is the most highly honored idle
and fro and dispatching of adjutants was confined to the to
and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may surroundings
and from him slipped a gold coin into his hand and always herself
and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of east
and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment vicomte
and from which prince andrew was surveying the position was the stood
and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect napkin
and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be round
and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in shoulders
and frowning more and more discontentedly
and frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and problem
and frowning sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his dejected
and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nobleminded
and furniture of various kinds a table chairs and a stood
and future hunts of rugay and ilagins dogs while natasha sat past
and gaily triumphantly
and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his about
and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does ear
and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards portrait
and gave him a slipper for his left foot with a childlike necessary
and gave him commissions for others only when he himself herself
and gay she sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and light
and gay to kiss her hand i know shes a scamp of a girl fearless
and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier away
and general movement that something was constantly expected important
and general orders and constantly studying historical movements
and genius give him the victory at austerlitz and by chance chance
and genius in napoleon and alexander but we shall be unable ability
and genius the generals who of all the blind tools of foresight
and gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see him ladies
and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully nobility
and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to study
and get it for me said the old prince to mademoiselle go
and given two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm office
and giving orders for which everyone came to her preparation
and glanced into the room sonya standing beside her at the cautiously
and glancing at pierre she went out of the room tenderness
and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the veranda
and glittering eyes face
and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand darkness
and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that preoccupied
and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere careless mournful
and go into bondage i dare say ill give you grain indeed houses
and go nowhere no i wont let you off mademoiselle george moscow
and go to tarutino which was between the roads along which those road
and god only knows where your man peter is said the other prince
and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now the arakcheev
and gone forward of bolkonski nothing was said and only those left
and goodfornothing when kutuzov conforming to a custom blameworthy
and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they epistles
and governesses followed singly the footmen began moving tutors
and governesses from behind the crystal decanters and fruit tutors
and grace thought mademoiselle bourienne tact
and graceful action as if flying through the air without high
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the rapturously
and gratitude the princess heard her not heeding her words affection
and great man let us drink to his health and to the enchanting
and great people and know how to deal with them all its ministers
and greetings deafened natasha and the light and glitter footsteps
and grew more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed them
and grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew sightseers
and groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing screams
and groans sometimes feigned or so it seemed to rostov he screams
and grunting an aidedecamp who had entered the bedroom twitching
and guns secured the booty divided not without some prisoners
and habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial deliberate
and had a double meaning amusing
and had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been oldenburg
and had already been sent for village
and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and petersburg
and had brought from there these connections with the emperors
and had given orders that news should be brought to him of assented
and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything surmises
and had him enrolled among the cossacks expeditions
and had just returned from there as a special messenger he prussia
and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the depression
and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed circles
and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov private
and had now as if purposely sent his men to the very rostovs
and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts on that wheat
and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for spacious
and had since filled that post irreproachably for bogucharovo
and hair frock
and half their belongings did so from the latent patriotism houses
and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for in
and handing on to posterity of a certain important preservation
and handsome young man and woman for one another and this healthy
and happily and suddenly he remembered how his love had strongly
and happiness here on earth toiling suffering struggling enjoyment
and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to health
and happy expression the same man who had rushed out of the stupid
and happy eyes at her sisterinlaw bright
and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the congratulations
and happy in these novel surroundings that she only lighthearted
and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who concentrated
and happy than before tranquil
and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the animated
and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the glance
and hastened to reassure him fortune
and hastened to supply it others in that heat and crush racked say
and hastily passing between the rows came toward their box animated
and hated held him in their power loved
and have another look and then come back to me go
and have no pity for me why is it war
and have not quitted moscow officer
and have pursued ever since to this place the position hollabrunn
and having deduced the refutation he needed would again thought
and having done this he rode back order
and having given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with reticule
and having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his study count
and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and steps
and having once arrived at them clung to them correctly
and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he hay
and he added let the emperor but say the word and well nose
and he asked the count well
and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was them
and he could get no farther and again his handkerchief and sobs
and he could not breathe he knew that he must do something to chest
and he could not jest with them water
and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the approached
and he gave way to an old mans sob faltered
and he had not made use of it what have i done emperor
and he had to remain with his regiment and since it had to beginning
and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always golitsyn
and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find intensity
and he heard those people anatole and dolokhov shouting and they
and he held out his hand to the captain pleased
and he ignores her shameless
and he is appointed well and then asked the other voice removed
and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes yes
and he kept expecting something more more and yet more insufficient
and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward helplessly
and he often thought about her but he never thought about her him
and he only had to shake himself to be ready without a stone
and he paused finally one cannot impute the nonintervention
and he pointed to lavrushka himself
and he pointed to the village in front of them with the there
and he raised his foot to the stirrup i
and he raised his hand to his white horse guards cap with a weight
and he really had understood all she wanted to say but understand
and he sank back in his chair opinion
and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he death
and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning it
and he turned on the box toward his master peter
and he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer captain
and he turned to go well
and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court his
and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the enjoyed
and he was keeping the bank rostov had not seen him since money
and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in army
and he went on writing going
and he went out to give the order telyanin
and he went up to the boy darkened
and he wept lord
and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our command
and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if thousand
and heard platons voice enfeebled by illness and saw his fire
and heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking bigger
and heels and fling me into a hole that i may not stink under head
and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he austerlitz
and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other panting gown
and helene side by side prince vasili was not having any pierre
and helene still sat talking just as before pierre
and help he is a most absentminded and absurd fellow but advice
and helped him i know and understand what a spice that would add him
and her alone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine her
and her brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by men
and her face was animated which however did not conceal its done
and her face was tearful eyes
and her look seemed to say well it is your own disconcerted
and her loose locks of gray hair kerchief
and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in beauty
and her sleepy breathing audible visible
and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry fault
and heres nicholas cried natasha running up to him ah
and heroic endurance destruction
and hid it under his waistcoat pistol
and hiding her face in her hands princess mary sank into mystery
and high boots and shakos epaulets
and high boots at an open desk on which lay abacus and some cloak
and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was higher
and hills in the distance and despite the fact that the roofs
and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face camp
and his attendant with uncle and his huntsman were nicholas
and his attention was suddenly carried into another world a fly
and his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces princess path
and his companion at erfurt where he had more than once met emperor
and his corps had laid down their arms other przebyszewski
and his daughter with an infant in arms they were half clad pole
and his face wore a strained look as if he found it attention
and his family military administrative political and himself
and his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of the father
and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head wave
and his friend obolenski had lately in secret agreed to join he
and his head slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his collar
and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on pale
and his love brother
and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated napoleon
and his marshals nor was there any need of that special and emperor
and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the piteously
and his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies flags
and his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit back
and his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as knouted
and his one division and even then mortier slips through your mortier
and his originality at once made prince nicholas intellect
and his power only the resultant of various forces and then his time
and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking words
and his roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring pillows
and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever bast
and his son brother
and his son vasili
and his sudden rush of passionate love of life two steps from ball
and his suite were returning to the town the commander in kutuzov
and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas lip
and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya nicholas
and hissing continually around them he spoke in the tone singing
and historical laws deduced by observation and by which psychological
and hoffmans drops vinegar
and hold their own however incongruous their presence and appear
and holding out the letter more
and holding things like daggers in their hands they began cloaks
and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this terrible
and honor and glory to whoever captures him he says this silly
and honor him yet he set off to join his army and at every love
and honoring him why i have not yet had time to settle loving
and hoped they would not be noticed spectacles
and hopes of happiness or goodness in prince andrews dreams
and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her dreams
and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey carts
and horses the rain was descending in torrents and rostov cattle
and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army putrefaction
and hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at host
and hostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent unfamiliar
and houses but there was no army shops
and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who drivers
and how badly the latter would fare now especially if bonaparte
and how did he speak yes
and how glad i am that he is alive again on one side of the died
and how has it ended i was against this marriage even then soirees
and how he would set upon it hope alternated with despair come
and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most well
and how is she asked pierre well
and how nice it all was theres uncle shinshins brother has arranged
and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or ambassador
and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue orders kutuzov
and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and why
and hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and stretch
and hungry and weary making his way past the baggage commander
and hungry man munching his food rapidly with his strong healthy
and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voice boldly
and hurriedly removed detached
and hurrying along by the fence he turned several times to pierre
and hurrying blocked the street thronging
and hussars and willingly accepted that role now he had been cossacks
and i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my young
and i am sitting here ill as you see splendid
and i am sure there will not be a happier man than you marry
and i beg you all to help me brunns attractions must be difficult
and i continued pierre shot dolokhov because i possible
and i dare to condemn him she thought at such moments feeble
and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies stand
and i dont yet see my chessboard clearly go yet
and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything yesterday
and i have no money so i was going to ask the count out
and i have some money and a letter to give you he added yes
and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in frontier
and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my anything
and i rushed to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands him
and i said i should have known you had i met you by changed
and i shall leave the children in an excellent position life
and i shall run with them and it death is here above somewhere
and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum rendered

and if you like i will tell you that whatever happens and win
and ill at ease constrained
and ill come for you dangerous
and ill see the old prince snorted let her marry its all stay
and ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather rostov
and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the rostov
and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change rostov
and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way to rostov
and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows along
and immediately a deafening roar crackling and whistling made flame
and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking exclaimed
and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite energy
and important one was entrusted to dokhturov that same difficult
and impossible as such happiness seems i must do strange
and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity strides
and in a whisper with a strangely unsmiling face unexpectedly
and in bad form but here he felt it incumbent on him to improper
and in fact his health was poor another
and in general something extraordinary was happening and somewhere
and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of another
and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and mary
and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person decided
and in her own way proud princess hard
and in her voice i have had so little happiness in life that eyes
and in his turn has offered that as an explanation him
and in my dream i knew that these drawings represented the drawings
and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter meeting
and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong err
and in others parts of our realm for consultation and for the capital
and in prussia we do not know for certain in how far his austria
and in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms attacking
and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless suitable
and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the sleep
and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give lifeless
and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at battle
and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she daughter
and in the company of wellknown elderly and respected action
and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a else
and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men perfection
and in the same order in which they had entered but with scraped
and in the same way every action of an insane intoxicated committed
and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and begun
and inability to enter a room and converse in it absentmindedness
and incomprehensible but he remembered her as he had last transient
and indeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a myself
and indicating helene with a sorrowful gesture ah she is eyes
and indistinctly you thought rascals blackgaurds rapidly
and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told involuntarily
and inheritance but i do know that since this young man whom wills
and inquired what regiment they belonged to they belonged carriage
and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white dissatisfied
and inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and frightened
and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with impotence
and inspired expression at the spot where anisya fedorovna had changed
and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had father
and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran pistol
and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of interesting
and insult alexander just what he had least desired at the himself
and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another distinguished
and interesting helene was in doubt which of the two men unfortunate
and interrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would forward
and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperors conflicting
and intonation that obliged one to listen to each expression
and invited her to go with them she sat down and played with chairs
and inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed expecting
and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire disguise
and involuntarily waded kneedeep in the bog it
and irony as though he was really saying that all desire bitterness
and irrationally but later on to fit what had involuntarily
and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class obligatory
and irritability depression
and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward excited
and is inconceivable exist
and is that all he asked well
and is unlike herself glad to throw her father over and she tail
and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes make campfires of it
and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow replied
and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till events
and it seemed to her that god heard her prayer happiness
and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than door
and it was death and prince andrew died entered
and it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of irritable
and it was whispered the youth and inexperience of the incapacity
and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday today
and its bright green stood out sharply against the thickened
and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard bridge
and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to course
and its food one part of it dispersed and waded kneedeep lair
and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen shed
and ivanushka is here too said prince andrew glancing with a ah
and ive been losing bwother i lost yesterday like a weally
and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with solemnly
and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent keys
and joking began when there were quarrels his kindly disputing
and jolted him at every step adjutants
and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by continuously
and joyously nearer and nearer to their goal suddenly the lightly
and judge of its purity only by the inner purification of vessel
and julie were saying to one another the governess kept nicholas
and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might slippers
and just as they would have cried vive lempereur at any stick
and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a eyes
and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief magnanimity
and katie sleepy and disheveled beat and turned the heavy nightcap
and keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex combs
and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her anything
and king protects them and considers no one among you his emperor
and kissed him at the same time only his mother was not talked
and kissed only her hand after their engagement quite her
and kissed the hand which lay under his head nicholas turned tiptoe
and kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps hand
and knew how to listen so that people readily told him conversation
and knew that he was face to face with death when he came to sky
and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no time
and knocked three of them over hussars
and know for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is know
and know what life was he asked his sister to forgive understand
and kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to clerk
and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of another
and kutuzov with the same expression on his face again manner
and labored transitions was sounding even the connoisseurs breathing
and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with them innkeepers
and lamenting as they said goodby a small watchdog ran round wailing
and langerons columns which had already gone down przebyszewskis
and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn emperor
and laughing at his own sensibility when princess mary regretting
and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from which war
and lay down to sleep beside his companions went
and leaned against the wall to keep from falling to see him pale
and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot ladies
and leave it to me i will tell her when i can i wish it parents
and leave the pickets retreat
and leaving large sums of money with them for alms went masons
and left the room the old count began irresolutely to vexation
and let there be but one banner that of active virtue prince right
and let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the again
and lieutenant telyanin a small officer of the same voice
and life he asked himself without finding an answer and childhood
and life that made his personality what it was and from education
and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised bottle
and lifting his eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but pockets
and lightly touched his hat mustache
and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder coat
and lingered for a moment flank
and listened to what the housekeeper was saying handkerchief
and listless as if they were old creep slowly about without shriveled
and lit up widened
and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in loved
and lively as ever twice they noticed the french appearing merry
and long after her candle was out lay openeyed and motionless bed
and long before she again sang as she did that evening the sung
and looked angrily at him bondarchuks horse swerved and galloped him
and looked at bezukhov the stern shrewd and penetrating hair
and looked at her youre here he seemed to be saying and eyes
and looked at telyanin the lieutenant was looking about in his it
and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been vivat
and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel nicholas
and looked up with that curious expression of inner happy working
and looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and people
and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing songs
and looking carelessly about him up
and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so head
and looking like something between a cart a cabriolet materials
and looking straight before him with a smile that did not dolokhov
and looking uneasily and timidly at her eyebrows
and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding denisov who horse
and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he beauty
and love as i have for you then i am young mamma does confidence
and love brotherhood
and love for that man overflowed his happy heart pity
and love her or would do without his consent then he marriage
and lurching with his whole body and puckering his face stirrup
and made out the word it was drink drink a drink rostov listened
and made some steps on the very tips of her toes together
and magnificence of napoleons court luxury
and magnitski have been deported to their proper place speranski
and maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services kill
and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in beautiful
and majestic expression of imperial welcome gracious
and majestic light around and already he felt himself mild
and majestically but can it be true that i am in impressively
and make you weep you
and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess smiling
and making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a dalmatic
and maloyaroslavets and make conjectures as to what would tarutino
and mamonovs regiments which looted russian villages and pierres
and manner here in moscow to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed tone
and many others though these men had no military wolzogen
and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate prisoners
and material something that he and even she was this limited
and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as she
and me dearest
and meanwhile the very next morning after the battle the sleep
and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story sad
and mechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o lazily
and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old washing
and memorable an impression on him in the forest the strange
and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not thoughts
and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to front
and menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rose terrible
and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be himself
and merry faces it was natasha sonya and petya who had hair
and merry faces pelageya danilovna began to recognize the flushed
and merry voices could be heard from there another branches
and met his gaze face
and methodically to collect the provisions of which army
and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in paulucci
and might have been funny but it lacked just that something witty
and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained russians
and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the soldiers
and mind of the man in question the more subject to character
and mingling with one another he could also by the spreading
and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau mistresses
and minutely examining various religious philosophic and seriously
and mirth that shone in all their faces evidently in the excitement
and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting modeling
and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map assiduous
and money and dolokhov and anger and honor its all misery
and more advantageous to live in the counts house than preferable
and more and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had more
and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new more
and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping brighter
and more impatient the nearer they got to moscow more
and more manlylooking but what amazed and estranged pierre paler
and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive forgotten
and more than twenty sat down to table every day these were people
and mortified nicholas in the first place he was sorry that grieved
and moskva rivers was broken and hilly between the hollows kolocha
and most contradictory rumors were current in the town some strangest
and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating easiest
and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it plain
and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and most simplest
and mothers hands asking for their blessing and that he fathers
and mounted on a lean darkgray horse the other in an uniform
and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace nose
and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet toes
and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at letter
and murders which would have to be committed during that robberies
and muskets and accouterments put in order boiled
and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this vice
and my body on the other i looked round and saw brother a side
and my coachman has gone oh
and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give all portmanteau
and my father and then talk of rules of war and children
and my love has no aim but the happiness of those i love wrote
and my people have they reached moscow at last he asked moscow
and my relations with father i want nothing from him i have me
and my valet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly boy
and mysterious part of the prediction extraordinary
and mysterious reflection direct
and napoleon with the long train of their suites alexander
and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons infantry
and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince nicholas
and natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he himself
and natasha following the direction of that look saw an newcomer
and natasha had said to him are you remaining in rostovs
and natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and minutes
and natasha sat down beside a little chess table with sonya countess
and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing sonya
and natasha understood that but simply because he thought it was mary
and nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon nearer
and nesvitskis and dolokhovs sabers which were stuck standing
and never coincides with the direction of any one force advance
and never forgot anything if he now incurred natashas censure house
and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely pictures
and new people that interested him the more interesting his places
and nights with a wallachian woman prince andrew asked kutuzov days
and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas resumed
and no longer need our aid said kutuzov victory
and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks yes
and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment time
and no one else at that time the two famous decrees were being day
and nodded to them he liked to see new faces orderly
and nodding to right and left as casually and goodnaturedly crowd
and noisy but the different companies did not get mixed hurried
and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered shoulders
and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man europe
and not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the war
and not become vehement but almost always did become himself
and not even that but even were they ten thousand thats more
and not greeting anyone the young ladies there to the portmanteaus
and not in the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on man
and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was list
and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a reign
and not to obtain from us any cococounsel ourselves
and not to the deity man
and not with his eyes only
and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else time
and nothing is important its all the same only to save trivial
and nothing more said natasha yes
and nothing to recall that terrible loss to dolokhov here in father
and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs stupefied
and noticing the glance he turned on natasha as he rose surprise
and now a horn but better and clearer than violin or horn violin
and now after dolokhovs proposal and iogels ball seemed winter
and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were ears
and now all is changed she thought as she sat with the happened
and now as if trying to atone for her fault paid forgiven
and now as the postulant to the accompaniment of sufferer
and now at princess mary when they left the table she fatherinlaw
and now for tikhon or dron dunyasha the nurse and the ivanovich
and now forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics icons
and now held a rather important post in vienna both the copenhagen
and now here we stand hungry behind
and now in this cond always
and now repudiated the deed now ordered the people to catch moscow
and now smiling happily wincing
and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him along speed
and now wrote french verses in albums concerning his share moscow
and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly drowned
and obstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then naughty
and obtained that manner which the pas de chale would one spirit
and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the instructions
and occupations the war and so on the preoccupation and journeys
and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and people
and of bonaparte himself i remember his limited selfsatisfied that
and of course in the karagins drawing room and julie moscow
and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans to fighting
and of her for being his sister that there is no reason father
and of her own youth and of how there was something unnatural natasha
and of his orders during the battle not being as good as occasions
and of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin moscow
and of how to get away quickly and save himself himself
and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of affairs
and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their father
and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of ideas
and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the arrival
and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk and why nights
and of the whole army had to remain stationary in face of transport
and of uncle pierre whatever he may tell me i will do it me
and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all commiseration
and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three soldiers
and officers of various regiments they saw on their left soldiers
and often had an influence on matters considered important rooms
and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized room
and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the tight
and old men and women pierre could not understand why he did not young
and older visitors they now stretching themselves distinguished
and olmutz is a very decent town you and i will travel olmutz
and on a french cavalry saddle with a merry and tipsy face jacket
and on a spree one a tall fairhaired lad in a clean blue drunk
and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that ready
and on foot stood at the corner of ilyinka street overcoat
and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied surgeon
and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he rostopchin
and on the right a porch there were people at the entrance river
and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the open
and on the twentysixth the battle of borodino itself took side
and on their left flank uvarovs cavalry had put the borodino
and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of lempereur
and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy wounded
and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said him
and only awaited prince bagration to begin the council at last tea
and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the countess
and only the reports most flattering to our army were followed
and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to laughter
and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince him
and oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt constrained
and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange neatness
and orders seem very bad and every learned militarist dispositions
and ostentatiously approached the officer swinging his hurriedly
and other historians with profound respect were as enthusiasm
and others at that time a famous joke of ermolovs was front
and others like them walking singly across the field shouting white
and others the historian evidently decomposes chateaubriand

and sent him on errands but to pierre he always goodnaturedly
and sent word that they would not let her leave the village that barn
and serene expression in her face there was none of the soft
and service interests and intrigues as usual only in the interests
and settle his wifes affairs and must rebuild in moscow petersburg
and seven years previously had listened to the discussion denisov
and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs quickly

and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible wished
and she was calling on the rostovs for that purpose the together
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with handsome
and she was right said countess mary with a happy smile laughing
and she went in the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat be
and she went to the window and opened it through the open irritably
and she with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats her
and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse cloak
and sheepskin coat cap
and sheepskin coats without a roof over their heads in the boots
and shining eyes and prayed god to help her face
and shining head and complacently seated himself on the scented
and shirts for them boots
and shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which him
and should fascinate her husband as much as she did unmarried
and shoulders and glanced at nicholas head
and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their squadron
and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he saber
and shouts in the enemys camp rostov rode up to bagration lights
and show that the new force they have devised does not themselves
and showed him all sorts of favors pierre
and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played proud
and shyly quietly
and significant memories of the last few days rose one after calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no calm
and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who trouble
and simply as if he were doing something not merely quickly
and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his suddenly
and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the shouting
and singing some incoherent song and approached the staggering
and sinking down again into her former position effort
and sinking heavily into an armchair in
and sisters laughter it could never enter his head that brothers
and sit down to business in front of a map where he greetings
and skittles the general trend of the campaign was rarely quoits
and slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair plunder
and slightly wounded had left it long ago all about the uninjured
and slipping between the legs of the generals she projections
and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna arrive
and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was officer
and smiling contemptuously to himself legs
and smiling eyes
and smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room said
and smolensk held out all day long at the battle of borodino town
and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at crumpling
and smother it and the victim enfeebled or killed drops fight
and snatching the portfolio from her mikhaylovna
and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her shying
and so before one can know it is necessary to believe and to self
and so berg drew pierre to it discussion
and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and hearts
and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under decays
and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had irony
and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry fortune
and so he did not like zdrzhinskis tale nor did he like it
and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked well
and so he went from one group to another some of the most guests
and so i have killed two birds with one stone to appease unpunished
and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own agreeable
and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power destroyed
and so it is possible to find some connection contemporaneously
and so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to times
and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more others
and so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg company
and so on and these pictures of the future had given him her
and so on but these orders and reports were only on paper naples
and so on health
and so on like all those polish names prishprish
and so on on
and so on that pierre became quite bewildered and only permits
and so on what for people in their full vigor is an aim cleared
and so patiently thought she looking at sonya who also came long
and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and half
and so rendering their own plight still worse treated prisoners
and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced steps
and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him it
and so was the countess but natasha who had bustled about dressing
and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said yes
and so you no longer wish to marry boris nice
and social tact thought he been proud of my house in which beauty
and social topics were ended and the time had come for political
and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was emotional
and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable suspense
and soldiers do not write history and 2 that spiritual traders
and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood stern
and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer loud
and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the joyful
and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french broadsheets
and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed coffee
and some of these laws are known to us while we are events
and some pills in a pretty box of a ruble and seventy kopeks powder
and some unknown x mass
and some wine answered the captain yes
and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table club
and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not said
and sometimes forward and the cavalry dashed without orders in back
and sometimes strangely indifferent faces the same exhausted
and somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her surprise
and son father
and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre father
and songs and coming from the field where the review was held music
and sonya and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer countess
and sonya and hastened to inquire after mammas health natasha
and sonya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had mother
and sonya she valued the company of those to whom she could mother
and sonya that when one goes on and on recalling nicholas
and sonya they are lovely door
and sonyas life in the countess house had grown harder happening
and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah another
and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are generally joys
and sovereign i submit only i am sorry for the emperor benefactor
and spent most of their time together when one went out the another
and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the enthusiasm

and starving and the column that had been presented frostbitten
and state councilor and not merely these but a whole state assessor
and state the patients condition understand
and stayed for months besides that four times a year on servants
and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her herself
and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see hussars
and still more rapidly after it despite rostopchins calls borodino
and still taking no notice of the special messenger papers
and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her there
and stooped glass in hand over the infant eyes
and stopped at the village of aristovo preparing forminsk
and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered dismounted
and stopped something
and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of order
and strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count him
and streams and try as he would he could descry no military mounds

and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of thought
and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration long
and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what am i obeying
and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself impossible
and suddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing whetstone
and suddenly princess mary will tell her and she will be sure this
and summoned lelorgne dideville the interpreter him
and supper were over but the visitors had not yet cards
and support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt refresh
and surely recognized lavrushka was not in the least abashed easily

and the whole crowd had to wait bridge
and the whole family wretched wrote the countess me
and the whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and submission
and the women in the house began to wail away

and their servants marya dmitrievna with her spectacles rostovs
and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the french
and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand added
and then after i met her under such circumstances so strangely her
and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on silent
and then all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostroma possible
and then assume a most serious deferential and innocent grimace
and then at last dragged her off and behind the scenes something time
and then at the other officer
and then blushing pale
and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna laughing
and then can save him from actions which would torment him now
and then continuing the conversation they were now moment
and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted knees
and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of now
and then four more appeared and then from each with the same three
and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders strings
and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also shouted
and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a morning
and then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to bogucharovo
and then neys ran as it were the gauntlet of the russian davouts

and then with a distressed face left the room to find conversation
and thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier drissa
and thence to moscow princess mary alarmed by her bogucharovo
and theodore uvarov who had arrived with him paused at the bekleshev
and there amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of here
and there are plenty of them as it is it would be different if born
and there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had unite
and there bezukhov got off scotfree while fedya had to together
and there further on are the french said the officer yes
and there he pointed to a sutlers tent they crowd in and hand
and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever conscience
and there look at this well my boy the old prince dinner
and there was a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black crack
and there was bright joyous sunshine on natashas face as she over
and there was someone to fire at trained
and there was the former agitation and obscurity he brainspun
and therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a thing
and therefore should not exchange when my opponent has lose
and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men space
and therefore when describing some single state they assume persons
and theres nobody there go and gather the clothes together calling
and these transfers a more than usually complicated play emperor
and they all shunned one anothers eyes only a de dejected
and they did indeed get somewhere though not to their right other
and they had such and such favorites and such and such badly
and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her listen
and they have given me a st georges cross i cant make trembled
and they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes or whisper
and they laughed with quiet enjoyment blend
and they must go to sleep in their covered cart or ceased
and they say there was no negro at all but you see you natasha
and they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who laugh
and they were called to breakfast natasha kept looking appeared
and they were more excited but pierre though he felt that streets
and thin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular figure
and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a pierre
and thirty get there the rest either starve or get killed so away
and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred
and thirtysix of them removed the balloon that was being hundred
and this event was accompanied by its justification in the another
and this is not a time for discussing he continued but for yes
and this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an off
and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious sadness
and this quiet regular life is very bad for him others activity
and this ringing high pitched laughter from a statesman made a laugh
and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest dubiously
and this thought occurred to him just because he himself arm
and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a rejected
and those in which form prevails to the latter as prevails
and those living in the neighborhood of moscow may without husbandmen
and thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little smile
and though all pierres interest was now centered in that visitor
and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say conversation
and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get frenchmen
and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as harm
and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone architect
and though it was not so called they all felt that this purpose
and though still holding their positions they had lost one battle
and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems enemy
and though you may not know it the fact is that now dolgorukov
and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a life
and thought of this knew

and time are my warriors my champions thought kutuzov patience
and time they will do it all but the advisers nentendent patience
and timidly and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step sadly
and timidly in the direction of his trap singly
and titi and pitipitipiti boom flopped the pitipitipiti
and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in excitement
and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger governor
and to do quickly glowing with the heat and from running he do
and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk said
and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another yes
and to experience but in fact such subjection does not reasoning
and to face danger only then expressing known historic facts fight
and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in significance
and to have the last word she promptly changed the triumphantly
and to her fathers memory assuming that she did go down to see her
and to maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct debates
and to offer the russian army the three days truce negotiations
and to other posts but he always persistently refused justice
and to peasants evoked no response there were no workmen
and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob encounter
and to reassure the inhabitants but pierre did not know looting
and to repeat what they had already told her many times questions
and to rest after their hard marches clothes
and to suppress robbery duties

and was now so kind to her natasha brightened up and felt important
and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could firing
and was only seen in its entirety when it had been circumstances
and was quite covered by an apron on the box beside the hood
and was ready for all that was good faults
and was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of adorer
and was seized by terror lest he had already in some way others
and was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who stopped
and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures love
and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with poverty
and way of life were glad of pierres return because they knew acts
and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of began
and we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to battle
and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself room

and which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and himself
and which is now no more they reek of decay and death only a guarded
and which they were trying to pass over in silence consideration
and which when they were ready she always triumphantly needles
and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts mention

and who was one of one of the disinterested friends so man
and who went once to the nizhni fair with a companion a family
and why along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground where
and why are you exciting yourself do you think the french hussar

arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the presented
arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling his
arms board them no you shant get it he yelled to
arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the powerful
arms he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the his
arms of the doctor who held her up the
arms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other russian
arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they others
arms were being given out everybody was escaping going away gates
arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest his
arms with the precision and definiteness customary in their
army
army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a proud consciousness of that
army advanced of itself upon the russians carried forward by french
army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at our
army along the kremsznaim road bagrations exhausted and entire
army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors whole
army and besides this nine men in every thousand for the regular
army and i wont not even if bonaparte were here at smolensk russian
army and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed the
army and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached russian
army and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived russian
army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy the
army and which constitutes the sinew of war kutuzovs words the
army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning the
army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any and
army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing russian
army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a french
army as a whole or in sections against petersburg or napoleonic
army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication with
army behind before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with the
army bewails it and calls down curses upon him whole
army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident the
army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino that
army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french an
army ever deeper and deeper when water is spilled on dry ground the
army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were one
army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely jest russian
army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino russian
army gains a victory by killing three five or ten enemys
army go on harder harder he muttered hunching his russian
army growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with the
army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated their
army has gone eh what people against gods might our hands the
army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses its rights an
army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place the
army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the
army i understand tolstoys too a simultaneous mikhelsons
army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank every
army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort whole
army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot that
army melted away and perished at the same rate from moscow to french
army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the the
army of sixty thousand men and according to thiers it was russian
army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke at austrian
army orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the
army our
army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a his
army the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent the
army they were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of an
army to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the
army turned more to the south along the ryazan road and nearer to the
army was broken up but the russian army retreated immediately neither
army was flying from russia with all possible speed that disorganized
army was melting away french
army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses the
army was not only did no one see this but on the russian russian
army was one of the russians understood what was asked and russian
army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing napoleons
army went on essentially as before french
army when he was needed there now when his part was played out the
army whole
army with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front fighting
army without a battle the
army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river the
army you are in a position to seize its baggage and russian
armys campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind our
armys foraging operations provision trains and hospitals when the
aroma all around the flames flared up again lighting the cakelike
arose among the wounded who were waiting murmurs
arose in every soul for what for whom must i kill and question
around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment angrily
around as if asking what it meant the same question was looked
around glanced
around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy all
around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and before
around him merged in rostovs mind into a single feeling of corpses
around him merrily then it seemed to him that bogdanich rode looked
around some particular incident so now the courtiers themselves
around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of crowding
around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a something
around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so and
around them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the or
around them they would have captured murat and everything and
around unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the country
around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all all
around which tens of thousands fell and which the french centre
aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a had
aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the memory
arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness song
arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to that
arrange for departure of the prince the princess his son and the to
arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that be
arranged it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my be
arranged matters thus denisov and dolokhov intended without having
arranged near the watchmans hut in the forest and told the place
arrangement adopted when they started that the officer the
arrangements and its such a beauty it pulls out and domestic
arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve making
arrangements for natashas marriage occupied him for a while he the
arrangements further
arrangements the count grew quite tranquil domestic
arrangements the maneuvers and his profound plans which napoleons
arrangements would be made by napoleon during the battle necessary
arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that was
arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to after
arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a began

arrival of dolokhov diverted petyas attention from the the
arrival whats the matter rostov you look as if youd just macks

arrived and theres a letter for you has
arrived at places where they evidently should not have been and
arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the troops
arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having yet
arrived the latter returned to russia in a new country andrew

artillery could be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk the
artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having our
artless smile she had met him in secluded passages and
as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set connections
as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only petersburg
as a child believes in the speakers tone of conviction believed
as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years it about
as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had there
as a great secret and
as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf rather
as a living being by the fact that he wills that is is himself
as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established reputation
as a man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its great
as a man recently returned from abroad in a political him
as a mark of the commander in chiefs special favor he was bullet
as a model of ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince regarded
as a mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly so
as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to now
as a partner and the old men began smilingly to talk about again
as a position than any other plain in russia and there advantageous
as a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a out
as a pretext for disputes and intrigue this kutuzov knew well only
as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living except
as a regimental commander close up to one of the tents and there him
as a renegade french subject michaud toll count stein who was to
as a result he could not go to the country with the rest of moscow
as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to force
as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks masts and just
as a savior received
as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to long
as a surprise for natasha or sonya or for nicholas himself present
as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former forward
as a veranda served
as a wall on this knoll there was a white patch that rostov steep
as a whole army corps the progress of the war was eagerly much
as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter but
as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in and
as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him peuples
as always did not quite keep pace with them though they sonya
as an ambush that they should not be seen and might be position
as an entertaining supposition him
as an officer and men began to run toward it a general who was soon
as an unseen hand directed his actions long
as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove and
as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two action
as at austerlitz what science can there be in a matter in thousand
as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the strange
as at the beginning but even had the aim of the russians battle
as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity again
as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the fear
as author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might vanity
as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general cheerful
as befitted a grownup man and an officer without hinting at denisov
as before all his former amusements lost their charm for externally
as before some playing cards there was plenty of money themselves
as before such as she alone had the gift of arranging at soirees
as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they just
as before yet when under the same conditions and with the thing
as calm and aloof as his look voice
as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they election
as clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing is
as commander in chief and our first foe buxhowden is appointment
as commands were related to events historians have assumed which
as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with soon
as elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience here
as equaled zero we should even then not have arrived at inevitability
as ever fresh
as ever when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came same
as everything she did in his presence and looking up at graceful
as far as ear could reach there were the rattle of wheels before
as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its only
as far as possible retaining troops in reserve methode
as far as they could be known to anyone in our army his own him
as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the kutuzov
as for instance in a war or a revolution and so without event
as for the french vanguard rostov as a careful squadron it
as for the man who advised forming this camp the drissa camp and
as frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an amiable
as from a bottle he had that moment been wounded and his greatcoat
as from the attempts the viceking made to execute the orders sentence
as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not done
as full of life as themselves but now so much to be formerly
as general mack have by now already gained a decisive leader
as gentleman of the bedchamber which at that time appointment
as good as another as you know and even if it is only archdukes
as has been devoted to describing the actions of various historians
as having when wounded in the right hand taken his sword in the him
as he always did to what the speaker was saying the approval
as he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came looked
as he began speaking quivered
as he broke into a gallop drooping
as he called it twice during his career kutuzov had been vilna
as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated trap
as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his drones
as he continued to deal rostov
as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him still
as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious powers
as he gave his horse into an orderlys charge and he felt trembled
as he got up and at that moment he felt that something wondered
as he had been detained at the palace he did not say that sooner
as he had not done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in pray
as he had to say something he began by asking her whether but
as he himself had seen and understood it and
as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle credit
as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officers saddle coat
as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction fro
as he lay down pulling his coat over him muttered
as he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to pierre
as he marked the figures in his clear bold hand chalk
as he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice saying
as he opened the door speaking from under the filmy skirt father
as he pointed at the old men with his free hand air
as he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on musket
as he rode by adjutant
as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily palpitating
as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his face
as he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden ones
as he seemed much upset by the rostovs visit freak
as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him and why little
as he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god submitting
as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we bagration
as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them especially
as he termed it to himself he treated her coldly avoided womanish
as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was felt
as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with soon
as he was always liable to do of late i can only say that irritable
as he was and people felt pleased by his presence contented
as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened just
as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole that
as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his andrew
as he watched her she did go first to her cousin surprise
as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly and
as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from just
as he would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray peer
as her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of soon
as her mother and called her so that i am spoiling countess
as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare such
as his eyes filled with tears sobbed
as his parents house precious
as his wealth his education and his social position had freedom
as horseflies to a horse him
as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so the just
as hostess threw significant glances from behind the duties
as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen destruction
as i always fear when her face is like that thought he and dies
as i am happy
as i am now tranquil
as i entered the anteroom i heard andrushas peals of laughter grew
as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and provinces
as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faint just
as i told you very well next day which was yesterday vienna
as i understand your present life i think you will always count
as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are its
as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten behaved
as if at a command everyone began to run this
as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with back
as if convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered but
as if disdaining to use all four everything pleased it now legs
as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this shake
as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping face
as if fearing to be too late again shouted hurrah with a voice and
as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do absentmindedly
as if from corporal punishment and could not avoid suffering
as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his felt
as if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed fluttering
as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into gods own joyful
as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and hurrah
as if he were saying something which had long since been speaking
as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions spoke
as if in alarm on seeing her mistress suddenly
as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she and
as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to round
as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to francis
as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose its
as if it had been forgotten there face
as if it had not finished saying what was necessary thudded ball
as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and astonished
as if looking for something round
as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of felt
as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it something
as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to friend
as if she did not recognize him smiling
as if she had asked him to do it gravity
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions looking
as if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance is
as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were approached
as if the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved looked
as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to pierres words felt
as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two seemed
as if their differences would be settled there amongst the line
as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and muttered but
as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then instant
as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his and
as if to reassure prince andrew bagration
as if to say yes thats how i want you to look entered
as if turned to stone hundreds of riders composing the motionless
as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his carefully
as in 1808 of the great nation and the great man and 1812
as in a camp it
as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of just
as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and just
as in a vise head
as in all practical matters nothing can be defined and which
as in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the all
as in her beauty of which he had heard much well
as in imagination she told this story to him her seducer and tears
as in its last note you understand besides unless expressing
as in michael ivanovichs list wax
as in the case of killing a man as the result of contradictory
as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of themselves
as in the former chigirin talks pierre pondered over these jocose
as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the just
as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is just
as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without was
as insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily appeared
as is always the case not a single column reached its place at and
as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow suffering
as it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that strongly
as it had to go that is never in the way people devised but them
as it is enough
as it is i have to postpone my return for three months you know but
as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do life
as it may be ill tell them all to hold their tongues and hard
as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she attention
as it reaches rich pastures so did the army disperse all over soon
as it seems to everyone in such cases that it was merely some him
as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his which
as it should be arranged
as it used to on the contrary it tormented her more than satisfaction
as it was everywhere else just
as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority affectionate
as it was for sonya she watched her friend and did not let her hard
as it was quite unknown what character the war would take some long
as it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia nodded
as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet strange
as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go and
as it were lightheartedly and
as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made having
as its substance is forcible long
as legitimate so that he is now count bezukhov and recognized
as lovers of music do when they hear a false note the two frowned
as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont change much
as marya dmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the having
as may be the historical account of how some king or strange
as may happen answered rostov karay here he thats
as mental activity is to you or me you cant help existence
as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war regarded
as merrily and prettily as ever just
as morands and gdrards divisions for whose movements no heights
as most people thought them but which to pierre were defects
as much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has regiment
as much as i like and as i like said petya to himself delightful
as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and position
as much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help you defense
as much as you like but all the same bonaparte is a great laugh
as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by part
as much selfconfidence as if he were addressing school children with
as much space as possible but others striving to do the same occupy
as natasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn pray
as nicholas had occupied himself with sonya of late little
as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look just
as not to be in her way so
as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward so
as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and corn
as often happens had not understood a word of what they were but
as often happens with old people kutuzov began looking about and
as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in such
as old maid apprenticeship
as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston pierre
as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it wounded
as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder white
as peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for buffoon
as petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound soon
as petya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that happy
as pierre mastered his wrath i dont know that and dont confident
as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him just
as pierre remembered it three months before when the count had same
as possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a quickly
as possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune late
as possible kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road long
as possible sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in dressed
as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had far
as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors them
as previously it was seething in its depths historic figures shore
as prince andrew entered marking the place with a knife closed
as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came toward just
as rostov passed through the anteroom voices
as she conducted him to her aunt
as she glided away and how she carries herself for so beauty
as she had never experienced before all that was distressing pride
as she had not known for a long time such
as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome wife
as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by sometimes
as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples but
as she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped something
as she sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else correct
as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her reproach
as she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the newcomer
as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen ashamed
as she who had herself suffered so much could render and friendship
as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections mother
as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him was
as small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed look
as soon as all is over and prince vasili sighed to intimate then
as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly changed her position it
as soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his before
as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy but
as soon as possible before we are turned out of petersburg peace
as soon as she looked in a glass she went on reading expression
as soon as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and again
as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away and
as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat but
as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented but
as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and and
as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodino the bridge almost
as sorrow was manifest in every smile the sound of every word but
as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty tooth
as surly as a dog is
as swiftly and cruelly from both sides crushing human bodies just
as tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as twice
as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden himself
as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it recent
as that very adjutant whom he so hated friend
as that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the painful
as the cause of the emperors anxiety that day prince vasili no him
as the cause of their sufferings deprived of power and regard
as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew dreadful
as the creditors threatened he reentered the government remainder
as the daughter of prince vasili but visualized her whole body not
as the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and far
as the emperors quarters were he believed not far off immediately
as the emperors suite was a very small one it was a importance
as the expression of their age journalists
as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the well
as the first post station far
as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference army
as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands flag
as the french entered but the french entered and still pierre soon
as the key to the whole position regarded
as the man who does not give his name and under that designation
as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall just
as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven just
as the old men have decided theres too many of you giving its
as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that bartenstein
as the product of many forces can no longer it would represented
as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the accept
as the result of innumerable and varying forces did people there
as the result of the will of one man or of several men itself
as the russian historians who maintain that napoleon was drawn right
as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches just
as theodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore himself
as there was nothing to said and neither wished to give successfully
as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last together
as they crossed the virgins field him
as they enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however much
as they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by boldly
as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying soon
as they looked at the beautiful helene with her radiant face duties
as they passed rostov going or coming and nicholas who adjutants
as they watched him from the knoll smile
as they were jolted against one another almost all of them carts
as this year which delays my happiness will be continued hard
as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is tortured
as those that occupied him evidently these girls legitimate
as though about to smile and once on coming out of the raised
as though embracing her time
as though he had long expected him door
as though he were in his own room around him thronged moscows ease
as though offended yes no to petersburg tomorrow but i and
as though she had not expected it to the charm of the notes joyfully
as though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure smile
as to his employment but asked him meanwhile to remain on decision
as to how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked curiosity
as to lead to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as so
as to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending conjectures
as to something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently tale
as to the force on which the authority of some particular statement
as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to reassured
as to the last meeting between father and son it was so edifying
as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him battery
as to what was happening in the world little nicholas skepticism
as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess questions
as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to thought
as to who he might be perhaps a very important person uncertainty
as to whom the honor is due even foreign historians dispute
as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as slightly
as uncles pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had just

battle a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce of
battle after borodino at which the french had been routed another
battle all he had seen that day all the significant and impending
battle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons his comrades of
battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred the
battle but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity impending
battle having passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the for
battle if it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if giving
battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we a
battle of austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with russian the
battle of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army the
battle of borodino there was a soiree the chief feature of which the
battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that the
battle of shevardino were fought there also exists a preceding
battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had the
battle proved physically impossible fresh
battle tomorrows
battle turned to the right and reached maloyaroslavets joining
battle was actually fought this position protected by the the
battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron this
battle will depend and not on those others success tomorrows
battle would have been won to speak of what would have happened the
battle would have taken place where we expected it in that case the

battlefield and something that had long been slumbering that
battlefield could be seen the
battlefield galloped up the

be a good thing since he himself was so firmly convinced that would
be a man to
be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to
be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day would
be all right on a loaded cart shall
be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent cannot
be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father would
be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only to
be animated by the same desire to
be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts to
be arbitrarily selected always
be at its head to
be at stake but this one is too light its not becoming may
be attained by conflict and 3 the attainment of the chief only
be back again from the army and would certainly write to his soon
be bad as regards the unwritten code thought boris but not

be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing to
be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down could
be conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of all

be cut off said he will
be dealt to the right rather than to the left might deprive him seven

be done not
be done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a can
be doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that would
be dressed princess marys selfesteem was wounded by the fact should
be easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more would
be empty said the old woman to the old attendant will
be even more careful of her appearance than when she was should
be executed after passing through borodino the viceking was not
be executed could
be executed is impossible not only in the case of napoleons cannot
be executed since they are my foes they cannot be my should
be explained in what this new force consists for the whole should
be far easier and simpler for him to die others are being would
be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world could
be felt to
be finished he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and must
be firing at the enemy to
be for me i am used to suffering may
be forgiven but i didnt say i could forgive her i cant should
be forgiven him for he enjoyed much will
be found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there to
be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions to
be glad and not cry should
be glad to sit beside you and rest im tired but you see id
be good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad perhaps
be got from his answers the old valet tikhon with sunken could
be gracious to our unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy but
be had at a low price the tone of the proclamation was not as could
be halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher should
be happier with her than with some dolllike julie i can certainly
be he what he may they always began like that he is an chief
be heard around the campfires dolokhov turned into the could
be heard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit sometimes
be heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs could
be held next day prince andrew as one closely connected with to
be his wife that he had no means and they would never let her not
be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to will
be imagined or adequately praised said berg glancing round cannot
be in a more prominent position continued berg and vacancies shall
be in me what there is now but perhaps hell come today will then
be in time for the governors party to
be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government
be kept out he seized the door making a final effort to hold it to
be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully all
be killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this to
be killed would
be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old mans to
be left behind on inquiry the countess learned that madame not
be left that way we shall be saying there is no god nothing will
be lelyas name day i will invite two or three people and if he will
be less panic and less gossip ran the broadsheet but i will will
be like him he thought enviously to
be like this she thought she kept looking round in turn at the to
be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it not
be lost to the home and secondly from his hussar point of should
be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship this poetic to
be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with always
be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the will
be my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own will
be no battle kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither would
be no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue could
be now listen give this letter to michael ilarionovich i shall
be of any use and only in time to be fired at toll who in this to
be off he shouted whether we meet again or not goodby

be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule would
be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors himself
be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see will
be punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat will
be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be might
be quick he said please
be quiet i tell you cried the count with a glance at his petya
be quite frank mary i expect fathers character sometimes to
be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october must
be regarded as a force that itself produces events yet in seem
be renewed but princess mary saw by his face that he recovered
be responsible she remarked turning to the author i have wont
be rising high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low to
be safe would
be safeguarded since such is the will of the greatest and most will
be said beforehand and heard it all only because he had to would
be said of each of you he was in the great battle before moscow it
be satisfied but pierre believed it without any mental never
be satisfied would
be seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the already
be served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee should
be sewn up with cords would
be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing what not
be so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into count
be so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and please
be so quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures would
be sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being should
be standing over him or what was said of him he was only might
be strictly adhered to said he drumming on the table with must
be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long would
be sure we all have to die im not against the commune to

be surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte will
be surrendered and then dispersed all about the town to the would
be taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i shall
be taken wheres the hurry them
be talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lovely to
be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the god

be the cause of events history shows that the expression of the could
be the chief desire of everyone else always
be they what they might objections
be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers to would
be to unload the muskets muskets explode the ammunition and to
be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had might
be transferred to the guards at once said she would
be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart and to
be unable to remember yet they sat at tea round the samovar again
be unable to withstand it now but he also felt that on what would
be understood differently yet looking at sonya she agreed with must
be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet to
be unfair to
be unkind cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table dont
be well would
be whipped as soon as napoleons interpreter had spoken says to

be worse for you bogdanich is vindictive and youll pay itll
be worse if he fires the bridge see heres an officer jammed itll
be worthy of her and that is what we shall see must
be worthy of it this rescript began with the words sergey to
be yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of dolokhovs not

consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor the
consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and the
consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was the

could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that eventuality
could arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and transports
could at least take back your words what if you want me to do you
could be altered without spoiling it voice
could be and without solving this problem or at all before
could be descried the officers said that either napoleon horsemen
could be discerned irony
could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french alarm
could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in action
could be heard door
could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight forces
could be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now asleep
could be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which blows
could be seen and in three places to left and right the grabern
could be seen and indefinite masses of troops ours and campfires
could be seen pitchdark brother isnt there something to nothing
could be seen through the mist and here and there the roofs of church
could be useful and without any premeditation prince vasili man
could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets bagration
could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the he
could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening beausset
could find no satisfactory position he kept closing his eyes and he
could find nothing to reproach them with but even they disagree
could give no opinion on such an important government order and he
could give them strength to move on and endure their present alone
could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar nesvitski
could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would himself
could have produced veteran
could he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed less
could he see the battlefield he had expected to find but only nowhere
could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained what
could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and ragged he
could hear that lavrushka that sly bold orderly of denisovs was he
could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my but
could lead to love on her part still less on his or even herself
could let him have till may and asked him to be more economical he
could never in any case be renewed and
could never overtake the tortoise resulted from this that achilles
could no longer be averted but was taking its course begun
could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was pierre
could not alter the inevitable course of events and that council
could not and did not wish to break this silence pierre
could not answer can something bad have happened to me he and
could not be delivered in time if news was received one obtained
could not be done because the flagging spirit of the troops it
could not be missed the rostovs moscow house had not been moscow
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob father
could not bear to remain inactive and has left the enthusiasm
could not break away from her and that though it would be a he
could not carry the weapon in his hand through the certainly
could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in sonya
could not continue long that a catastrophe was coming which in
could not did not wish to believe that he
could not do that the people only gave him power that he he
could not enter she
could not finish and ran out of the room he
could not for a moment have failed to recognize her he
could not get in or out but went on turning uselessly in the screw
could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in she
could not go on he gulped and turned away pierre
could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more she
could not have done more said napoleon growing more and great
could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had she
could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to received
could not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke french
could not know their meaning but must keep them the second pierre
could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to he
could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions he
could not make out distinctly what was in that tent the andrew
could not make out what it was all about and still less what pierre
could not marry for he was married already said pierre he
could not marry he is married he
could not move it he smashed a pane but
could not on my honor but how is petya i
could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order they
could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha he
could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his former director
could not refrain from weeping at these words touched that this she
could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel he
could not remain calm seeing him in such a plight she natasha
could not reply but
could not rise rostov also tried to rise but fell back his but
could not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind he
could not serve as material for science therefore
could not spare at such an important moment to return to him when he
could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the he
could not think how to address the reply if not as consul and of we
could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond kutuzov
could only be negative but had said it with a shade of happiness
could pronounce pitts sentence he saw a wellbuilt and london
could say anything against that truth which they all napoleon
could see one anothers faces and speak to one another besides men
could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one he
could see the raised hood of prince andrews caleche she did she
could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being neither
could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his neither
could she like other women vera meant herself attachments
could so the intentions of the french highness
could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this else
could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in why
could therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the and
could understand all that she understood and all there was in her one
could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that never
could understand or explain alive
could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to what
could weve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not we
couldnt see a thing how they shot at their own fellows you
couldnt take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in we

did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him pierre
did not and never will know it and now it will never never be he
did not answer and left rostopchins room more sullen and pierre
did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh they
did not answer but looked cordially into the frenchmans pierre
did not answer but smiled uncle
did not answer but winked instead daniel
did not answer her questions natasha
did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would pierre
did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his however
did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot dolokhov
did not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of and
did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced recalled
did not arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and which
did not arrive till the thirtieth belongings
did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a he
did not begin the engagement he
did not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow who
did not care for society in general but prized the more the natasha
did not catch what they were saying but knew they were pierre
did not cease chattering goodnaturedly and gaily continually she
did not change her position but her whole body heaved natasha
did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary i
did not correspond to the course of events in the first case commands
did not dare to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who detachments
did not desire war and had no relations with england alexander
did not deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what numbers
did not disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the moscow
did not do so at once but continued to advance along the balashev
did not drag her away at once but sang with her for a long they
did not draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from her she he
did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the he
did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before he
did not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he he
did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to nicholas
did not even think or find time to think but only talked nothing
did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there and
did not exist for her evidently
did not exist for the countess her sons growth toward manhood
did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and i
did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when i
did not explain to himself what these new relations were he
did not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had he
did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or they
did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the pierre
did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance he
did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left he
did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile he
did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he he
did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air he
did not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the he
did not finish what he wished to say he
did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk natasha
did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a you
did not go to any large gatherings but only to small pregnant
did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the nicholas
did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even situation
did not hear him natasha
did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nicholas
did not himself know what rostovs relations with the polish who
did not improve natasha and nicholas often noticed their affairs
did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because alexander
did not insist further he had managed people for a long alpatych
did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that god
did not intend to devote her life to serving prince country
did not interest and did not even exist for alpatych orders
did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in russia doctors
did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the she
did not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he he
did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all petya
did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted rostov
did not know pierre
did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor davout
did not know that the brick buildings built to plan were being he
did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen pierre
did not know what to say he
did not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen which
did not leave me it seemed to me that his object in entering him
did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her she
did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to natasha
did not let him go he sat down sank into thought closed prince
did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me soldier
did not like natasha she thought her too fashionably dressed mary
did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging tikhon
did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did he
did not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish natasha
did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes rostov
did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned pierre
did not notice him following me she said timidly i just i
did not notice the killed and wounded though many fell near him time
did not now occur to him to think of russia or the war or it
did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked she
did not order it to be sold prince
did not overtake him so quickly borzois
did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was topics
did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not sonya
did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their alexander
did not relate to them down below a man wearing something shouting
did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the natasha
did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the he
did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess nicholas
did not reply but when they reported to him that murats kutuzov
did not reply he
did not reply he rode up to petya dismounted and with denisov
did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had kutuzov
did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the he
did not say that there were no covering troops though that tushin
did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who he
did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement pierre
did not seem to him senseless he understood and was not love
did not shift his eyes from one face to another as speranski
did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth he
did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his andrew
did not speak rostov
did not speak to sonya again and avoided her with the natasha
did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at pierre
did not stir she was in just the same position in which marya she
did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain municipality
did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her sonya
did not surprise pierre for she had become even handsomer woman
did not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov natasha
did not take her father away before the fifteenth he could princess
did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber denisov
did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in nicholas
did not take part and after that an armistice was pavlograds
did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as she
did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long andrew
did not tell you the whole truth i think there is no sufficient i
did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been he
did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on rostov
did not understand a word but the conviction that all this pierre
did not understand it in the bright light of the emotion evidently
did not understand one was taller than the other he wore an soldiers
did not understand what europe the balance of power or kutuzov
did not understand what he was saying any more than he did natasha
did not want to go but could not refuse marya natasha
did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew i
did not wish his face to be seen highness
did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen kutuzov
did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth he
did once but gave it up i am not fit for it thats it come i
did replied shinshin he was in the caucasus and ran away he
did say something about going speak to him i can do alpatych
did she say it yes i shall look forward very much to your how
did so correspond in the latter but
did so i have saved your life and i save your honor having he
did sonya run away asked rostov why
did speak her words would not be flattering to anna princess
did that fellow get here asked pierre how
did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did larger
did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do nor
did the right thing with such precision such complete she
did the star get into the icon pierre asked how
did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then why
did they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they nor
did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at only
did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never why
did this happen princess mary inquired when
did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there he
did would be historical and it seemed to him that it would now be and
did you get here said he turning to zherkov how
did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated prince when
did you give me tobacco yesterday thats just it friend and
did you know sake
did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic why

different from natashas she was putting away the things that quite
different from that of its elders which is often insincere manner
different had she been like this when he entered the day before quite
different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms rye cakes made with wine
different lodgings as soon as the men of the various their

different people businessmen relations and acquaintances these
different people to
different roads available for the french and one would have several
different she felt a submissive tender love for this man something
differently prince andrew had thought and said that somewhat
difficult and assumed more definite forms more
difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of insolubly
difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone these

had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look rostov
had been playing cards with the majority of the more dmitrievna
had been predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought things
had been prepared by innumerable socalled chances in his life this
had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole moscow
had been recovered and would be restored to him borisov
had been rehearsing and began telling him how he had already he
had been sent about with counterorders when it had become adjutants

had been something to be ashamed of in what prince andrew had there
had been spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a water
had been taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay pictures

had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day he
had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he he
had been trying first one remedy and then another worn out by they
had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of dinnerless

had begun to reply from the bottom of the slope where the guns
had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to natashas ears time
had begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought roused
had better go you
had better separate he muttered in a broken voice we
had better take care said the countess you
had better think it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no he you
had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared soldiers
had blushed and grown confused when denisov asked him whether he petya
had bought a wood from the prince had begun to trade and now advice
had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits natasha
had brought them together again but after that they never spoke which
had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after he
had caught a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely she he
had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved princess
had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his he
had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hair alone
had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which prince
had changed since he was at home last and having assured habits
had cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet weather
had come because moscow the capital was no more and only the army he
had come from borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering who
had come from the left flank where their regiment was dolokhov
had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in himself
had come in the year 1812 when the french emperor was fortytwo power

had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow for
had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for who
had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this petya
had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a death
had come there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone night

had done but berg did it a trifle late for he should have speaking
had done in 1805 and who saw in him not only all the virtues rostov
had done in petersburg at anna scherers reception he
had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to he
had drink served them the blacksmiths from a neighboring had
had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow himself
had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and who

had ears which though there was a piece of tow in one of them he
had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit god

had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door who
had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas malvintseva
had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely pierre
had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously paul
had expected he only heard dolokhovs hurried steps and his he
had expected of her as soon as she had struck her pose and uncle
had eyes only for bourienne i shall have to get rid of her and idiot
had failed him and now without thinking about it he had experiments
had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect pierre
had fallen and the roar of guns died away pierre lay dusk
had fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding thousand
had fallen in the wooden roof was collapsing and the rafters wall
had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his that
had felt continually all his life was now near to him and by he
had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top he
had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate magnitski
had followed and only the heavens promised peace toward torments
had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brothers love helene
had for living people if you liked him too it would be a good words
had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a who
had found so difficult to utter i love you it all comes from he
had fully understood after his talk with prince andrew and
had gained he tried to prove to the emperor the russia

had gathered round rostov a fresh arrival from the world outside who
had gathered things from different houses into this or that french
had given marshal
had given orders to harness and intended to start but when the maids
had gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how french
had gone on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had half
had gone out for provisions he
had gone taking his wife with him and had settled down with her he
had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had people
had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about and
had grown much older which
had grown restive under him and plunged into the water heading which
had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he
had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all natasha
had had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of he
had halted he stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip who
had handed him a knapsack and a flask and nesvitski was him
had happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to what
had happened the evening before yes yes all that has that
had happened to his beloved daughter and he so prized his disgraceful
had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled head they
had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a they
had he been absent surprised
had he not been a harmful person it has now come to my postmaster
had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society so
had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated perfection
had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman hardly
had heard of kuragins abduction of rostova which was talked of he
had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it i
had heard that kutuzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing he
had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of he
had helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation shame too
had him under observation interrupted who
had i been simply theodore vasilyevich my course of action tsar
had in anna pavlovnas drawing room pierre removed his feet had
had in fact been recaptured by other french troops and davout fleches
had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first she
had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak
had in it something very important and poetic had
had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre he
had interrupted countess mary sat down doing woolwork children
had just arrived at a gallop with bonapartes stern lemarrois
had just been hurt while blood from it was streaming over his which
had just heard particulars of that mornings sitting of the council he
had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife he
had just returned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a who
had known and always slightly feared he was in a womans dress she
had known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil who
had lady companions but who they were and what they were always
had lasted an hour and fiftythree minutes he noted this interview
had lately moved to dolokhovs the plan for natalie anatole
had left for moscow and though there was nothing for him to do sister
had left her dmitrievna
had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed assumed
had left his purchases he
had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes he
had left moscow and though everybody tried to acquaintances
had left paris and how he had liked that city anatole anatole
had left such a pleasant impression on his mind in her own home who
had left the countess apartments he was sitting upstairs in a he
had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests he
had lolled in anna pavlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed who
had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy julie
had long been familiar with that story karataev had told pierre
had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done he
had long since and often occurred to him during his military that
had long since been left behind and only the flower of the weak
had looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had and
had lost her former influential connections she had now society
had love been so much in the air and never had the amorous never
had made a strong impression on kuragin at supper after the natasha
had made for him from some leather a french soldier had karataev
had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year god
had made peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte and had we
had married in the early spring of 1813 and in 1820 already natasha
had meant she
had misfortunes but he is a man he knows whats what if he has
had napoleon then forbidden them to fight the russians they drunk
had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting rarely
had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which he
had never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters who
had never before seen on his face began to talk as one who pierre
had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious he
had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated i
had no connection with the matter in hand his haggard face which
had no idea that the village he was entering was the property rostov
had no meaning for anyone else but gave him some of the best which
had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties he
had no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your he
had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or he
had no time to realize who these men were he saw the senior he
had none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others he
had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not she
had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled pierre
had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what body
had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his there
had not come he was alone now except for a soldier who was doctor
had not deceived her that that state of freedom and readiness time
had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of he
had not done since childhood he
had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed pierre
had not finished the last verse before the young people began he
had not had a moment free since early morning and had not natasha
had not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she she
had not known it i should not have addressed you your view of i
had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained murat
had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when they
had not only held the field but had repulsed the french fight
had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to sonya
had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary pay
had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg boris
had not surrendered but had beaten the french russians
had not the courage to persuade denisov though he rostov
had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly i
had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs battle
had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to he
had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the she
had not yet occupied that region and the russians the french
had not yet proposed to her but
had not yet quite yielded went to inquire how he could arrange for he
had not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously that
had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone he
had nothing to hope from him especially as he did not know mothers
had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face pierre
had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he possibility
had now reached the utmost limit moscow
had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something they
had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across that
had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he thought
had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg pierre
had often been in other days and which as he learned from the pierre
had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she too he
had on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in had
had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at emperor
had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had michaud
had other virtues love of his neighbor and especially and
had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon smile
had passed the last of the russian troops he saw near a and
had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were denghien
had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an he
had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt scarcely
had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold friends
had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the which
had prince andrew started than he stopped him hardly
had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to brotherinlaw
had proved actions
had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every authorities
had rarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he he
had read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly he
had read out when he came that morning pierre had been officer
had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away he
had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in boris
had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at semenovsk
had received and given the orders for next days battle and had he
had received him as a member he did not find a single one there which
had recognized in the corporals words and in the roll of the pierre
had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong he
had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the she
had rejoined karataev and the grayblue bandylegged dog that pierre
had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow and
had remained in the street a shopman who entered told her that who
had replied that he could not come rostopchin
had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he he
had retained for himself prince
had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too they
had risen like his own at the firing and went back at a spirits
had risen visibly more than a foot flooding the dam because pond
had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining hardly
had round him telling them what he knew and listening to their who
had ruined his own happiness who
had run up and was looking down on the stretcher who
had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up garment
had rushed out from the wood he saw karay seize the wolf ulyulyuing
had said and looking at the departing trap superintendent
had said but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a he
had said but the sense of his words spread everywhere because kutuzov
had said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya wife
had said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha pierre
had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had she
had said that the festering might take a normal course then doctor
had said the war should be extended widely and whom andrew
had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon he
had said when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the host
had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told frenchman
had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had rostopchin
had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was she
had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting balashev
had seen it in paris quite clear and very pleasing who
had seen lying down she
had seen the body of petya rostov that same day he had learned he
had seen the emperor but there was no one beyond the ditch now he
had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round she
had sent zherkov to the general commanding that left flank bagration
had settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her times
had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the actually
had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of hitherto
had so often heard from his fellow hussars he
had sometimes to exercise her stillexisting faculty of she
had spent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre he
had spent the last few days and which was essential for the he
had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the inhabitants
had spread to the neighboring houses from which wounded men be
had stolen the sword of frederick the great bonaparte
had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said he
had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies ekonomov
had striven only for his peoples welfare the originator of the years
had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the rosenkampf
had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through frantically
had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of napoleon
had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth julie was at fancied
had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down him
had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet he
had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was sun

had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now pierre
had taken place came the report of musketry parleys
had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of which
had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal enemy
had taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of thought
had taken those first steps both had changed greatly since they
had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and saber
had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in seen

had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one social
had the letter taken from his pocket and the table on which he
had the pleasure replied prince andrew not only of taking i
had the reputation of being the most honorable and uncle
had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle all
had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at she
had thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her he
had tikhon called and having praised him for his activity denisov
had till now gazed over mens heads and gladly regarded the he
had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual that
had time to get his uniform he had on a shabby cadet jacket yet
had time to recover from him and begged the officer to let the not
had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the had
had time to think of what lay before her once

had to be ordered to keep the will in case

has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy history
has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not nicholas
has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which history
has time to think of the impression he makes on others but is who
has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several shavings
has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if who
has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if purchaser

haste packing their belongings and preparing for their enthusiastic
haste to satisfy all their expectations made
haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read and
haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling but
haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had feverish
hasten abroad with post horses would
hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the to
hastened to act but
hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as pierre
hastily back with their prisoners rostov galloped back galloped
hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the hussars
hastily stepping up without a word began weeping and kissing and
hastily wiped away her tears went resolutely up to mary
hat and seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he officers
hat and stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and his
hat tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded whiteplumed
hat was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of white
hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was him
hate you i hate you youre my enemy forever and natasha ran i
hated her and was forever sundered from her despite denisovs he
hatest it then change it purify thyself and as thou art thou
hatred and shame in all our subjects what are we scared at and of
hatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it expressing
hatred of the french patriotic
have a bitter feeling toward me what do you think what do you always
have a letter from him she replied i
have a look at it and kutuzov with an ironical smile about please
have a teteatete talk with the friend of her childhood to

have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the i
have addressed yourself first to me in that case you would would
have already refused she said hurriedly i
have already told you papa said his son that if you dont i
have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible to
have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud would
have attained the same end returned prince andrew every privileges
have been able to free himself but that prince vasili who had perhaps
have been as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage might
have been broken into wished to force their way in too and a fight to
have been calling you all night he brought out i
have been carried out for napoleon had passed the arbat more than now
have been caught once already by a little girl said you
have been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been they
have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible it

have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so might
have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the would
have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only would
have been no war would
have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen must
have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them now
have been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound would
have been quite different but it was my duty to safeguard my would
have been the savior of russia along that line of thought would

having definite means to maintain my wife i should be without
having described how he had that day seen kutuzov the newly merit

having dressed for his attendance at court in full conversation
having entered on the path of definition of which he was and
having exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was nicholas
having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and from
having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the horse
having given his name announced that he had to communicate denisov
having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to and
having got drunk the day before and left his master lavrushka
having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave and
having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not gone
having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw remember
having in its convulsive movement reached murats position army
having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number for
having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut and
having lain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french and
having left his people after their departure from moscow petya
having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in without
having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly pierre

having thus demolished the young man anna pavlovna turned to and
having time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left not

having wept talked and wiped away their tears the two thought
hay had any reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with for
hay lay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into newmown

he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew and general
he added and summoned de beausset who by that time had later
he added and was about to go to the drawing room you
he added dont be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from words
he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to karataev
he added for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has course

he again opened his eyes and said something none of them then
he again turned to pierre and
he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day where
he alone in contradiction to everyone else declared till his lost
he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian bonaparte

he and his party had been on the move all day long he had morning
he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the that
he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among sire
he answered his own question you see i was told to find out reply
he answered not recognizing boris what
he appeared in his place at the given moment and uniting the itself
he appeared to them a rather mysterious and incomprehensible
he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and staff
he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and as
he as it were considered his life afresh and arrived at journey
he asked again in french looking around and meeting establishment
he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so he comes month

he attacked mortiers division which was on the left thirtieth
he attended to army affairs reluctantly left everything to town
he awoke next morning the majordomo came to inform him that when
he baked cooked sewed planed and mended boots he was badly
he became her husband natasha on the contrary had at once before
he been doing all this time has
he been married long she asked on your honor has
he began but natasha interrupted him tomorrow
he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very liveliness
he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for and
he began reading the old prince now and then using mechanically
he began timidly at first and then more and more sophie
he began to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in which
he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince and
he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes and
he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing teeth
he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his teeth
he believed implicitly yet strange to say boris presence source
he bought he would sit in his study with a grave air books
he burst out into a fit of his broad goodnatured suddenly
he but i didnt invent it myself doesnt
he but i who moved you not
he call me why didnt he let me be there instead of tikhon didnt
he called again a few days later and began calling often resolution
he called out to denisov them
he called the grand master as
he called tikhon and began to undress thought
he calmed down not taking his eyes off her for some seconds face
he came because of sonya and sonya though she would never settled
he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them when
he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on when
he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking when
he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he medal
he cannot because because of and natasha burst into lives
he cannot cannot live because good
he cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his golden
he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the man
he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the and
he chanced to meet dolokhovs handsome insolent eyes pierre felt time
he changed the spelling substituting a z for the s and adding de then
he checked the advance because on learning that napoleon was krasnoe
he clasped his tobacco pouch inside the bosom of his dressing which
he closed his eyes his sobs ceased he pointed to his eyes again
he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory as
he clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring selfpreservation
he collected all his strength to stir and utter a sound differently
he collided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he bridge
he come natasha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move has
he commanded in a whisper the men took their places and mount
he commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported army
he concluded but am i really in moscow yes here it mere2
he concluded conscious as were others after the words conquer
he concluded history
he considered himself to be in the following words representative
he considered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love of one
he consoled himself with the thought that he was only sometimes
he continued to live in the same old way inwardly he outwardly
he continued with a sudden goodnatured laugh was that amusing
he corrected himself has shown or displayed in the battle of it
he could attack us he would have done so today said he if
he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an how
he could find it out before others in the figure in which he how
he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and when
he could have been received in such a manner only because thinking
he could have spent so much time on such useless work that
he could not agree to as what he always wanted most was alterations
he could not and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft but
he could not bear them that
he could not begin to speak instrument
he could not believe his eyes who are they why are they that
he could not believe that her fate was sealed especially skeptically
he could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in which
he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence so
he could not go back on his word and his father sighing and that
he could not have a moments peace and could not die quietly said
he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected beforehand
he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone live
he could not help being aware it just as we cannot renew an this
he could not imagine how he could speak to her now he petersburg
he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice said
he could not stop short for the sake of one mans life good
he could not suppress as they passed out of the palace sigh
he could not understand how the man who put them there behind reason
he could not understand that there for the first involuntarily
he could only have had it from the postmaster but evidently from
he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard so
he could stop but got no answer from anyone everyone
he could tell a story very well natasha listened to him spoke
he could to meet their wishes to sonya he wrote separately all
he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood nonsense
he cried noticing the cadets bright face youve got it wostov
he cried suddenly lifting his head bastards
he cried that
he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka go
he cried you are such a hero oh how fine how really
he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to but
he described to dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the opera
he deserves fate
he destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of completely
he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy thought
he did as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed as
he did everything so simply and with such assurance then
he did indicated his unusual position but dolokhov who in everything
he did it because
he did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart it
he did not at first recognize the place from which he had povarskoy
he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife if
he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt intellect
he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class liked
he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree people
he did not doubt that for an instant why should he not love her him
he did not know but was it really not possible for kutuzov to right
he did not know how to develop existed within him his meeting which
he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so suddenly
he did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess that
he did not need anything of that kind he neither saw nor ended
he did not purposely say things to please her but whatever natasha
he did not regain consciousness till late in the day when station
he did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and murat
he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only occupation
he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the though
he did not to confess that
he did not understand but which was working well action
he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to that
he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he battles
he died and i did not know he was alive how sorry i am that he yes
he died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death before
he digested his sufferings alone troubles
he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own pieces
he disliked them for their boorishness but
he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country oclock
he dispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiate tutolmin
he does not know russian him
he does succeeds the plague does not touch him the whatever
he drank a great deal he was only quite at ease when having him
he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept preoccupied
he dressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in while
he dressed to go to marya dmitrievnas if only prince andrew as
he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not him
he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned as
he drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin at the once
he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter again
he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously when
he entered the private room count rostopchin puckering his when
he entrusts our fine army to such as he consider that on our that
he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself ravine
he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion was though
he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but when
he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of as
he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had that
he expected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was catastrophe
he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that smile
he feared most of all that napoleon might fight him with his which
he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now as
he fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was and
he fell into my hands when id caught him id bury him in the if
he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been vision
he felt at peace at home warm and dirty as in an old dressing moscow
he felt flattered that after what had happened uncle him
he felt for both of them love
he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his before
he felt himself nearer to it death
he felt himself powerless limp and formless his father love
he felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approach
he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company sofa
he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not temporarily
he felt that this would not do and that tonight he was a once
he finds out and your brother and your betrothed suppose
he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life which
he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then himself
he flirted with a few of them at the balls but he did not run and
he followed the maid overtook her and came out on the steps
he forgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first that
he found him reclining in an armchair still in the same kutuzov
he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up which
he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new journey
he found it was a road having come out onto the road he reined it
he found so many people among them officers who like there
he found the cossacks inquired for the regiment operating telling
he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer ryazan
he galloped after the general causing the staff officers to reins
he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile face
he gave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are where
he gave me a notebook the one i am now writing in and in which end
he gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented charters
he gave the first reply that came into his head i like consideration
he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over dismounted
he gazed now at the city and now at the plan considering its light
he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she again
he glanced into rostovs eyes brows
he got his wound this pleased rostov and he began talking about where
he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking when
he got there he leaned on his elbows and smiling talked to when
he got up from his chair and went to the door himself
he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow till
he grumbled to himself what angered him was that the specimen
he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the bile
he had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight affair
he had almost been jealous on his wifes account was the admit
he had already occupied near kaluga position
he had already passed through the terrible and deafening roar which
he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man and so formerly
he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street when
he had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted affair
he had become a little quieter he explained to rostov that when
he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special as
he had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day him
he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not campaigns
he had been ordered to return to military service and after
he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it since
he had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in present
he had changed poured water over his head and scented when
he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of all which
he had come straight from the bath papa used to if
he had composed and to which he was trying to fit music which
he had decided to play until that score reached fortythree him
he had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with when
he had done on their first meeting at kochubeys speranski as
he had done seven years before at austerlitz as
he had ever inflicted on her trying to convict her he told injustice
he had experienced this before but never so strongly as destroyed
he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went world
he had feared the end he had twice experienced that formerly
he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile as
he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over when
he had fixed on that number because fortythree was the thousand
he had forgotten she was dead and tikhon reminded him that she alive
he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs so before
he had given when questioned had come back to him in his answers
he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column when
he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him that
he had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are thought
he had had when lying there it was unsatisfactory thoughts
he had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that joke
he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved views
he had himself composed which
he had intended carefully wrote twentyone thousand
he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he and
he had known from a child with this new conception of her whom
he had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white when
he had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome sportsman
he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he because
he had left all the others let him go and he ran to her since
he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter as
he had lost more than half his men he said the attack had repulsed
he had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the which
he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he when
he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there in that
he had no time he was afraid of falling behind the colonel
he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about again
he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression but
he had not at all expected such a sight just before him around
he had not known that he was dying how could he have failed to if
he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens some only plans
he had not seen battleground
he had not seen her with prince andrew it always seemed to him as
he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed but
he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had elated
he had often before during the last six weeks remained sitting
he had once prized so highly were still more so not only independence
he had only considered the possibilities of success but now battles
he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and always
he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than whether
he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the when
he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he campaign
he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the hand
he had promised to take home whom
he had quite lost his head and that it was probable that he had there
he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up before
he had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether when
he had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the which
he had really been there the night before and really seen whether
he had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to rostovs
he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he which
he had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a time
he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and when
he had returned as everybody told him a fine young man boy
he had returned voices were heard outside the shed whos after
he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and where
he had risen that
he had said she was charmante because
he had saved rostov took the joke as an insult flared up and girl
he had seen anna semenovna if
he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it what
he had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse fancied
he had seen him before where
he had so despised seven years before gentlemeninwaiting
he had so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the which
he had so long waited presents itself to him at last he firmly which
he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre whether
he had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and natasha
he had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and words
he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness that
he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand rubles
he had talked a great deal grew excited when he previously
he had the air of a man happily performing one of the shoulders
he had there seen the same pettiness worldliness and and
he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he as
he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their what
he had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him that
he had to give in and stop while carriages passed in determination
he had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be yet
he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the which
he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of what
he had understood that this woman might belong to him looking
he had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with whom
he had very little aptitude or inclination practical business which
he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it and
he has a dagger were the first words pierre lieutenant
he has again become as i used to know him when a child kind spirits
he has become thinner and more nervous i am anxious about him weaker
he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him today
he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp name
he has committed so successfully he reaches paris the crimes
he has covered france when i understood what he wanted when which
he has forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said expect
he has found one i think said ilagin carelessly yes we ah
he has given himself and his ideal of grandeur and glory which title
he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper night
he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man ah
he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince that
he has somehow grown so clean smooth and fresh as if he time
he has stopped austrias cackle and i fear it will be our shinshin
he has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to and
he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i and
he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now if
he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by though
he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldiers dance distance
he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the suddenly
he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure sounds
he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind suddenly
he heard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to conversations
he heard them shout hurrah and looking back saw that before
he heard these words and saw the expression of firm when
he heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of conductors
he held among them but those who surrendered while remaining place
he held as if ever ready to embrace something were rounded his which
he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed natasha
he held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually which
he here natasha quieted herself for a moment but again some isnt
he himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and and
he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his that
he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head and may ruin
he hurriedly took a pinch of snuff entered
he i have not read any papers i made it up myself if thats said
he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there thought
he imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and mind
he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go but
he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look is
he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch and
he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the petersburg
he introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come whom
he involuntarily remembered how dolokhov who had fully wife
he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i have papa
he is a fool thats all him
he is a freemason i have found out he is fine darkblue no
he is a rake and all that still i like him so you see i do though
he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy visitor
he is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow chief
he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence yes
he is a wise and clever fellow address
he is accused of circulating napoleons proclamation it is not if
he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and ah
he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voice then
he is always losing everything remarked the countess there
he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said yes
he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions if
he is and how attentive and how he remembers everything he fellow
he is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh you here
he is better ask pierre to dine with us he has been to the if
he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about now
he is connected with and the more power he has over others the people
he is dishonorable dont you know that i love him screamed say
he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and mistakes
he is dying pierre again began but
he is grand but kutuzov the man who from the beginning enthusiasm
he is his father keeps a cookshop here by the stone bridge fellow
he is holding on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea ship
he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when oh
he is in a very bad humor very morose be prepared ivanovich
he is in a weak state as you know said the old servant but
he is in disfavor now come here if
he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning there
he is no more no more natasha
he is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she perhaps
he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a if
he is our own kolya dear fellow how he has here
he is probably tired of them said another officer that
he is said boris thinking rostov had said his there
he is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night happily
he is so kind answered princess mary oh
he is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the and
he is still alive and gay and
he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you coming
he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it yes
he is wicked and heartless there now i like your denisov selfwill
he is young because he is poor because he is a because
he just came and then left off left off it
he keeps it all within him today he is cheerful and in sorrows
he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on though
he kissed her hand for the last time dont go she said in a leave
he knew and with the wisdom of age understood that it experience
he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men under whom
he knew it could not be helped though
he knew it would be some time yet before the order be experience
he knew not why the recollection came to his mind of a instant
he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the flank
he knew that everyone has friends you see i have considered because
he knew that his every decision would be approved by them peasants
he knew that sooner or later he would step across it but an and
he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a sooner
he knew was projected and with that object he had asked gerasim which
he knew whom he was dealing with der alte herr as in their that
he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself matter
he laughed unnaturally and
he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow and till
he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred so
he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and freedom
he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and and
he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life
he left moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but when
he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of and
he left the room the countess began to cry and
he liked her singing as he liked everything she did said
he liked the things they liked with others balaga because
he listened with quiet irony to bitskis enthusiastic insignificant
he longed to kiss his fathers hands and kneel to beg his crime
he looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new again
he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently empty
he looked around a captain standing beside him was gazing late
he looked at her whenever
he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his fathers tikhon
he looked at my feet friend well thinks i when
he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad fortnight
he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he and
he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was being as
he looked her way sonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid as
he looked in on boris hoping to find him alone when he tsarevich
he looked more closely at the ring with its skull a masonic hands
he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun attention
he looked to the right and saw something running toward him again
he looks very much like an incendiary remarked the officer ah
he love me natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her does
he love you does
he loved and he knew more than one thing about each of them which
he loved her only and was to come one of these days and andrew
he loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would whom
he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his yet
he loves me so said helene who for some reason imagined that oh
he made his reputation fighting them another
he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left hare
he made sport of the momentous and unavoidable event the child
he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off if
he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that whoever
he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will though
he meant by the words all is over and the counts papers are what
he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his which
he meant to look in answered helene and glanced attentively yes
he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active whom
he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place that
he merely said opinion
he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved everyone
he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was when
he met involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family faces
he met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag corridor
he met two of the landed gentry one of whom he knew this porch
he might be did not expect he was so used to submitting to whoever
he might easily become aidedecamp to the emperor you everywhere
he might give way to emotion when with her might become that
he might perhaps see and take part in the first russian time
he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her feared
he missed marya dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had whom
he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing in his senses
he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make continually
he moved toward the door blood
he munching a pie in his moistlipped handsome mouth would be added
he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he but
he must be moved onto the bed here it will be certainly
he muttered ice
he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage pierre
he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice theory
he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in wetched
he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and and
he naturally threw away the telescope through which contemplation
he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he seven
he needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul when
he never knew or remembered this must be one of her like
he no longer saw either our own or the enemys fires but trot
he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of time
he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he could
he nodded him
he not been able to explain the details of how metivier and feller had
he not been so goodlooking and had his handsome face not worn had
he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet had
he noticed her watching him raised his eyes and began to natasha
he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression when
he noticed that it should not have been put question
he noticed that there
he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded whether
he now came to his former chief with an order from the bagration
he now felt ashamed of his speech with its everything
he now for trouble rostov looked out of the window and saw said
he now knew prince vasili who having obtained a new post and bliss
he obtained his leave his hussar comrades not only those of later
he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly time
he often did and was glad when he heard someone coming as
he only appeared to be different but was really just like all of that
he opened his eyes his eyes he heard in front of him where the moment
he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the when
he opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had him
he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they robust
he orders i shall do you dont understand that what can i whatever
he ought it seems to me not to live if he reports that our him
he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision that
he ought to be shot general bagovut a fighting old soldier of that
he owed him money what baseness what meanness i know you because
he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room looking him
he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come soul
he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the whom
he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times as
he patted michaud on the shoulder you set me at ease eyes
he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to honor
he pities the boy ill show them tomorrow whether im a boy will so
he planned another garden and began a new building for the animated
he pleased all history would be a series of disconnected as
he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village and cossacks
he poured too many drops into the glass he threw the unintentionally
he presented to prince bagration on the salver lay some which
he punishes disobedience and crime strict measures have been how
he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to words
he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but him
he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his alexander
he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign when
he ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to resolute
he rattled on telling all the gossip he had heard among the so
he reached him rostov who was a splendid horseman before
he reached home it was already getting dark some eight when
he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in when
he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office when
he read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it sleep
he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some when
he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse virtue
he realized from the first that he would not get up again bed
he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me can
he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep soon
he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kind yes is
he recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of new
he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and then
he received letters from his parents in which they told him of 1810
he received the news of the battle of borodino and the when
he recognized anatole kuragin men were supporting him in amputated
he recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her eye
he recounted how raevski had led his two sons onto the dam raevski
he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as as
he reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good petersburg
he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fathers memory which but
he regarded the whole business of the war not with his him
he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow view
he released bolkonskis arm to indicate that he had now quite and
he remarked churches
he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when sometimes
he remembered long afterwards nor did she cry when he was gone which
he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look of go
he repeated but still he patted pierre affectionately on nonsense
he repeated several times mmmarateate
he repeatedly expressed this came about because his conviction

he sang pretending to hiccough after each syllable musketeer
he sank on the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he saber
he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who and
he sat down at the nearest table and
he sat down facing pierre by the way you know german german
he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on morning
he sat motionless looking at the heights visible above succeeds
he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess once
he saw before him something like a river but when he reached valley
he saw before him what is the connection of that man with my what
he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far indications
he saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights though
he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words yesterdays everywhere
he saw happening around him that evening was in some way what
he saw in him a remarkable clearthinking man of vast meeting
he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers when
he saw the stewards accounts according to which the everywhere
he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and that
he saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now which
he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude profile
he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion princess
he says wolves
he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his but
he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such had
he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he and
he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening attention
he seemed about to cry but this did not last long puckered
he seemed altogether so thin small and pathetic his motionless
he seemed not to notice he enlivened the whole party the presence
he seemed to be saying so much the worse for you sentiments
he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed suddenly
he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step and in left
he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army but
he set out with post horses for voronezh advance
he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when that
he shouted bottle
he shouted loudly and angrily take it off blockhead lavwuska
he shouted order them not to crowd together adjutant
he shouted suddenly to the publican bind him lads murderer
he shouted though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka him
he showed a bag a hundred flints i bought them very cheap and
he showed her the broadsheet count rostopchin writes reading
he showed her things
he sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise eyes
he singing about whats
he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet and
he smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love doing
he smiled delightedly he ran up to them though
he smoked and who owned some splendid horses where
he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to cause
he sniffed and put his face closer to the window suddenly
he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that but
he sought at his very feet all his life he had looked over the what
he sought he stopped and looked about him those
he spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he these
he spent in moscow after the death of count bezukhov he would days
he spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest comrades
he spread a map on the table all eventualities have been up
he starts a row ill go away said prince anatole i cant if
he still a young man but no longer a young diplomat as he had career
he still continued to live in the country remarking that capitals
he still had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture because
he still here she asked quickly is
he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with victory
he stood in the doorway stopping now one pair and now dancing
he stood still they were moving toward the door boris veranda
he stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by arm
he stopped in the village at the priests house in front of time
he stopped listened to the firing and gazed occasionally
he stopped short and frowned rostov
he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown moving his other
he struggled against the confession of his weakness but intention
he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as if
he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a son
he suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort moscow
he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a defended
he suddenly said to berthier i cant send claparede send no
he suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from want
he suddenly thought yet here she is lying at my feet moscow
he supposed share the general russian antipathy to the would
he taken his medicine has
he talking about get along said several voices and one whats
he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor is
he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without no
he thought
he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers done
he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut deprived
he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his victim
he thought blame
he thought but having caught himself saying too much about feelings
he thought glancing at the lady in the black dress companions
he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed that
he thought so thats all there is in what is called heroism am
he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause kuragin
he thought the slur on my name and honor thats all nonsense
he thought this but still sat in the same place a strange pierre
he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i either
he thought without clearly defining who the villains and traitors
he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all either
he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and fahrenheit
he to himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would thought
he told her of external social events and of the people understand
he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever princess and
he told me himself but still i should not cry and she come
he told them all that so
he took a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly that
he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far which
he took part in it and its all true when mischiefmakers petenka
he took the glove in silence from the aidedecamp and services
he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety and time
he tried his pictures seemed incongruous and false it made him if
he tried not to dwell arose in his soul which
he tried several times to fix his attention on the masonic solitude
he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their position
he tried to hide it he himself suffered from the though
he tried to say thats capital of course shell forget sonya
he turned to go kindness
he turned with his glass to pierre mouth
he turned with the same request to denisov who was also a ladies
he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away and theres no good
he understood his commanders wish that
he understood it all though he really did not understand if
he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that words
he unexpectedly died that
he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup as
he uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was vereshchagin
he uttered with an effort please
he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his him
he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit will
he walked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various them
he walked on and
he wanted he was lifted up carried to his study and laid on what
he wanted to be learned wise and kind like pierre in nicholas
he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep of warmth when
he wanted to say and nodded approval what
he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him what
he wanted what
he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver and now
he was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when band
he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him that
he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was that
he was about twentyfive like all infantry officers he wore eyes
he was about yet they beat him a plate couture3 and where what
he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off midday
he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness reawakening
he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezukhovs that
he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his that
he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and not
he was always in a hurry to get where he was not and
he was an illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was when
he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that where
he was as little able as his father to change his opinion presented
he was ashamed to express his new masonic views which had presence
he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with exclamation
he was at home because he had left belaya tserkov where there because
he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do but
he was awaiting petyas return in a state of agitation passage
he was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle while
he was being crushed together with that of rapture still when
he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when thought
he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when accent
he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk when
he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this calm that
he was conscious after receiving communion and unction he which
he was dangerously wounded that
he was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt as
he was doing the right thing prince vasili did everything to get that
he was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait moment
he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was this
he was equally amiable to all especially after supper il them
he was every day more and more connected with her that it was eyes
he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration presence
he was fond and songs he did not sing like a trained singer which
he was fulfilling his duty he would have found one of the idle
he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men saying
he was going still on all sides there was what there had been which
he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget he that
he was in his perception the two were one and the same strong
he was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that position
he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so as
he was in the way and was the only one who did not monosyllables
he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that was others
he was interrupted several times by applause when the people
he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also as
he was lifted and laid on the stretcher still
he was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a unrestrainable
he was looking at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his that
he was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom advantage
he was no more the old count cried because he felt that because
he was not a spire at all but only an old german ruin that
he was not at all surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on inside
he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there they had arrived
he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was watch
he was not to be trifled with either in a word he was a course
he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters revealed
he was one of those who liking work knew how to do it french
he was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown bottle
he was pleasantly considering the probability of being head
he was preparing fireworks to let off that night him
he was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and that
he was rallied about princess bolkonskaya when
he was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because
he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse shoulder
he was saying but the emperor francis continued to look about what
he was saying i have been an atheist answered pierre what
he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that what
he was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is her why
he was shouting hurrah engaged
he was silent and she did not know what to say she perceptibly
he was smiling contemptuously at my words and i wished really to that
he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to day
he was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency whether
he was standing down below or from the knoll above on which where
he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to whether
he was still lying on the bed as before but the stern expression her
he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels there
he was struck by the change in him his words were kindly surprise
he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of meeting
he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the down
he was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became day
he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even knew
he was talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who that
he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had that
he was there to the one camp belonged the old prince because
he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already before
he was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were when
he was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the moment
he was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the which
he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment him
he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted as
he was using solely for the welfare of russia in prince which
he was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche as he when
he was when and where he was born and so on then he was again who
he was wont to dispose of all difficulties which
he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the and
he we want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have said
he weaker thinner asked the princess is
he well remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the floor
he went along and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly as
he went along he looked with pleasure at the years splendid crop as
he went angry and scowling and without answering questions as arrival
he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and day
he went blind and he dreamed that the holy virgin mother of the it
he went down that staircase and out into the yard no one entrance
he went into his wifes room she was lying dead in the threshold
he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas a arrival
he went on asking ones
he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of and
he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero people
he went on with an evident effort at selfcontrol and well
he went out with his spectacles on his nose buttoning his coat come
he went round the table in a merry mood sitting down now by supper
he went to petersburg they have formed why
he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find forehead
he went to the couch on which he slept gown
he went to the next one from whom did you get it and soandso
he went up to the window of the first house when a familiar as
he were heard or not whether
he were not he said quietly you and i would not be if
he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought if

he wished to help her and say something pleasant but could expressed

he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his when
he wondered appearing

he wore a red mantle and stretched his long legs forward shoulders

he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids or of
he would have approved of is our family life he was always so what
he would have done at that moment had helene not fled from the what
he would have done to a stranger as
he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign that
he would join the army might

he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could that
he would not and not because he could not in the middle of because
he would not have approved said pierre after reflection no

he would place himself at the head of the army gather round that
he would say provincials
he would say when killing napoleon well then take me and what
he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it betted
he would soon be back whether
he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it or

him a criminal and a year later they executed those who considered
him a fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the around
him a great man remarked the vicomte called
him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out to
him a lieutenant of the guards prince andrew came up to annihilate
him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just gave
him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it send
him a mild and attractive personality and a personal with
him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him as giving
him a new and joyous sensation afforded

him about
him about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising to
him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and to
him address
him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his at
him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of love
him allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had around
him almost every night he opened his eyes as they were closing to
him alone in which there was something more significant than in for
him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and leave
him along irresistibly but latterly when more and more bore
him along to me bring
him also for some reason what is bad what is good what executed
him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own treated
him an answer give
him an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid with
him an officer said the town is being abandoned get noticing
him and again laughed his frigid laugh through
him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he caressing
him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my surrounds
him and considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but disliked
him and conversation would be resumed to the accompaniment arouse
him and count markov count markov was the only man who knew how about
him and either perish or put an end to the misery of all europe kill
him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he to
him and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large from
him and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box to
him and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the to
him and he had not once been to see the rostovs since the day of to
him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the before
him and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so to
him and helene well what of it if you all know it thought at
him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on at
him and his mustache twisted upwards sat the ruddy upon
him and inquired where the commander and officers were the stopped
him and led him to the drawing room it was at first surrounded
him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek embraced
him and little nicholas did love his uncle but loved him loved
him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up interested
him and other bullets killed many of his men and his division killed
him and raised their caps to him when he felt he was being noticed
him and repressing the terror that seized her she pressed approached
him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my loved
him and rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be from
him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that told
him and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactical past
him and smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the see
him and smiled quietly before
him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to to
him and sonya and consent to their marriage then he forgive
him and stay to dinner if you care to she called after expecting
him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to to
him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more for
him and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to for
him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it of
him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and against
him and then again at his feet the former and the latter around
him and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in biting
him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by spared
him and though he himself has no plan he is quite ready for exalt
him and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended banter
him and to depend on him and from its lack of success this affair by
him and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only grieve
him and waited in the lofty antechamber ante chamber just as the visit
him and was horrified to find neither what meant still more with
him and were searching him around
him and yet he was pleased grieved
him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is from
him as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is informed
him as a man of her own class she glanced at him with recognized
him as executor confided secrets to him elected him to be a chose
him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting this happened beneath
him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer confused
him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing behind

him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that see
him away from surroundings in which protected from all the take
him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic take

him beside

him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty understand
him but he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on marry
him but no one answered him everybody was too excited and around
him but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in about
him but they also flattered him and he submitted to them astonished
him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and left

him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes given

hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the he
his abrupt stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and told
his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own of
his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor between
his adjutant to napoleon to demand reinforcements sent
his adjutants brother kaysarov
his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on of
his afterdinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely after
his again said the officer it was the shevardino thats
his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his by
his agitation whether going into action now with a single in
his air his peasants but napoleon came and swept him aside land
his and raised his hand to the kerchief as if wishing to shrugged
his anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a arouse
his anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should ridiculous
his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad was
his answers did not express his personal views but the general that
his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure despite
his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that since
his arguments others defended them young count toll disputed
his arm and really catching the tune flourishing
his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a frenchman sprained
his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him on
his arm began a longdrawnout soldiers song commencing flourishing
his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag and the horror of that
his arm waved
his armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard in
his arms akimbo began stamping his cold feet rapidly and setting
his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions and
his arms in despair the count left the room without flourishing
his army as mack had done at ulm losing
his army because he wished to or because he was very destroyed
his army for then already it bore within itself the germs of saved
his army he was advancing to certain destruction and it must have of
his army to danger on this march and it was best for him to exposed
his army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving and
his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had for
his associates had scope for its development in africa and
his attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on attract
his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the when
his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the before
his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile scratched
his back to natasha and now facing her but during the whole of with
his back to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the turning
his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little rubbing
his bald head over which she again looked at the letter embraced
his bare breast with the sword i held to it i could not be stab
his bed the pope the guardian of all that the nations hold into
his being with their party the countess had seldom been so angry of
his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps were champing
his bloodthirsty pride this icon of the venerable sergius the in
his blue eyes grew moist hurrah cried the three hundred again
his body constantly increasing it was getting lighter and lighter of
his body him
his bold tall close handwriting with
his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help make
his brains over it had he been asked what he thought of the racking
his breast at the words russian army i tell you frankly struck
his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he order
his camp said he what does that mean either he is from
his candle he sat up in bed then got up then lay down again lit
his cap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual off
his cap of
his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck at
his careless attitude pierre looked at them over his changing
his catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it prevented
his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use with
his charms because the business of their lives was to cure work
his cheek to be kissed offering
his cheeks twitching more than ever vasili
his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the but
his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his uniform
his childhood riding past the pond where there used always to spent
his children a blessing so he simply held out his bristly gave
his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also inattention
his childrens relations with their mother the harmony between him of
his coachman ferapontovs wife and children and the house alpatych
his coachman ordered
his coat and trousers the prince undressed sat down heavily on of
his coat when he had finished he turned to bezukhov and fastening
his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low over
his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth of
his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to at
his coming vexed me from the first and i said something adventures
his companion they became silent and pierre thought he saw the and
his comrades in distress is set down to his credit and again leaving
his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was of
his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a burdening
his conversations with the staff the letters he wrote from belonged
his conviction that she was a quite unusual and confirmed
his court uniform m de beausset ordered a box he had donning
his cowshed nor rostov back with his platoon from foraging cleaning
his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelically for
his creditors demanded from his father which
his crimes and his craft exposed he should have appeared authority
his cup away with his hand ill drive all his wurttemberg pushing
his curiosity by
his curly head with his thin neck exposed by his turndown turned
his customary bass in
his daughter princess mary and her companion mademoiselle with
his daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not asked
his daughters and move away against
his death and that she would not be able to bear it and before
his death to condemn anyone she thought desired
his debts said the militia officer speaking of rostov all
his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly
his desires of
his destruction and he who says that an undermined hill desired
his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty express
his dignity to give me satisfaction then beneath
his diplomatic career in comparison with pierres happiness the of
his direct command at least in accord with his intentions by
his direction and realized his danger laid back his ears and chosen
his disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he life
his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of in
his dotard father for a moment he hesitated whether he should from
his dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing at
his duel with dolokhov after
his ear above
his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre in
his efforts which was a thing he never allowed to happen wasted
his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and holding
his escape as quickly as possible from this position of the make
his example and the loud shouting continued for a long time followed
his example then the officers and after them with excited followed
his excellency had been at home as a kinsman he would of if
his excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in the hm
his excellencys courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it in
his excitement at the same moment natasha without drawing and
his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his on
his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the opened
his eyebrows raising
his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around opened
his eyes and considered up
his eyes and he was going out but became aware of an lowering
his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak all was opened
his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained and this not by before
his eyes and stooped down one bullet and then another whistled closed
his eyes avoiding denisov began buttoning his coat buckled rostov
his eyes call andrew he said suddenly and a childish from
his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that had
his eyes flashed lightning count
his eyes from him taking
his eyes from the colonels athletic back his nape covered lift
his eyes from the plan of the building taking
his eyes from the window and from dolokhovs back anatole taking
his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave and closing
his eyes he said in a low voice raising
his eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seams raising
his eyes lowered
his eyes meeting
his eyes opened wide with fear and joy and
his eyes rolled downwards of
his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and morning
his eyes she was frightened realizing that there was not that into
his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on up
his eyes to bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at turned
his eyes upon it told her to read the letter aloud when she fixing
his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen purple
his eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls hand covered
his face and a stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and suffused
his face as if stirred to his hearts core and himself on
his face caused his mother to await with terror and which would of
his face close to hers brought
his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision but
his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man yard
his face flushed suddenly
his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on and
his face grew red and was covered with perspiration delicious
his face in his hands with
his face leave
his face looked sad and he had grown still stouter since arrival
his face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad look on
his face screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head puckered
his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot behind
his face suddenly took on a morose expression he paused yes
his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to words
his face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its hot
his face wept outright covering
his face which had been scratched till it bled by his falling wiped
his family had carted corn all night or of the fact that his with
his familys and his friends and the enemys intention to and
his father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly like
his father for the first time in his life i did not censuring
his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his instructions
his father he feels for you emulating
his father with frightened eyes but did not cry because no one at
his fathers affected pierre so much that when he had resembled
his fathers consent and he could do the same but that she without
his fathers hand he pressed it to his lips and burst into seizing
his fathers room that huge room in which count bezukhov had died in
his fathers the field marshal made an appointment to see him of
his fault in our eyes the selfsacrifice of a father or mitigates
his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news sent
his favorite rostov on the shoulder patted
his features now expressed horror and fear all were still though
his feebleness or worst of all at dinner when there were no noticed
his feeling for her she knew that but it concealed express
his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will at
his feet to
his fellow officers consulted
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his pain
his fine eyes shining with emotion that my dynasty should heaven
his finger tips kissing
his fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to thrusting
his fingers spread out before his eyes said holding
his fingers twitched nervously and
his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with was
his first cousin and we are only second cousins you know married
his flushed perspiring face over
his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him to

in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily a man in a whip
in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sobbing
in the service heard with pleasure of the things done disappointments

in the shadow of the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed hid
in the shape of a man like an officer comes in and sits down to just
in the sharp frost so that i threw down the reins catch hold numb
in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he confined
in the shed with pierre was dying and pierre told the soldiers
in the sitting room some in the library some

in the smoke rostov hesitated whether to gallop after disappeared
in the smoke which the wind carries away lies
in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of visible
in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never recognizable
in the soil nor the oxygen in the air nor manures nor nitrogen
in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha only
in the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise face
in the spring of that year he received a letter from his but
in the square but everywhere on the slopes and on the roofs as only
in the square there was a striking contradiction the general seen
in the stalls the rostovs had not seen him since their appeared
in the steppe region round bogucharovo were it was peasants
in the stillness of the night when he slept nicholas suddenly it
in the stirrups trotted a cossack the officer a very young standing
in the streets french
in the sun here and there over the whole of that blue gleamed
in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday but
in the third person and imagining it was some very wise herself
in the thought of him he was living a real life seeing new only
in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he speak
in the town persons
in the town seen
in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a principally
in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground clouds left
in the vehicle an officer in charge of transport was beating woman
in the very house in vilna from which alexander had balashev
in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him pierre him
in the village commune and had recently been away driving influence
in the vilna province offered his country house for the landowner
in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having upwards
in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how consist
in the white uniform of the horse guards officer
in the whole house there was a feeling of awe at something but
in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his natasha
in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we universe
in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to men
in the wood wagons and horses were standing the horses were wood
in the world and for the french its immediate result was anything
in the world and therefore as an englishman always knows what state
in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his everything
in the world pierre had first experienced this strange and good
in the world prince andrew came up to her with downcast everything
in the world was

in the yard only someones orderly passed through the tranquil

in the year 1806 nicholas rostov returned home on leave early
in thee and to thee be all glory to father son and holy trust
in their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small sat
in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him and difference
in their attitude toward him could still be felt both taken
in their carts to pillage the town and in general personally drove
in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars nations
in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the astonishment
in their flight and spread out over a distance of separated
in their former battles instead of the news they expected of happened
in their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major soldiers
in their hands pointed at his breast among them stood a man swords
in their joyous and longsustained shouts afterwards expression
in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of connected
in their overboots on the table and began to reflect feet
in their own play interested
in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles once
in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began legs
in them but theres nothing nothing nothing no dont something
in them now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than rejoice
in them the traits of character the old prince called strengthened
in them unhindered your fellow citizens are returning every performed
in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out nothing
in them what there is in you not
in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much expression
in these days it would be hard to live without faith yes
in these things and to question pierre the questions put interest
in these times serve
in this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left confirmed
in this condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the been
in this life i did not and do not understand something
in this marriage he recalled her former words and looks dishonorable
in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week died
in this place which teemed with life nor could he even position
in this regiment ranks
in this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as talk
in this way the study door opened and on the threshold himself
in this world and never known anything so disgraceful lived
in this world and the next helene was touched and more affords
in this world but that i shall always exist and always vanishes
in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and enveloped

in town julie had gone and so had princess mary of his left

in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing together
in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little him
in vague general terms avoided talking with her and resolved countess
in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at not
in vain to find the answer to some question trying
in vain to reach he had long sought in different ways that striven
in very bad but selfconfident french then again like a sometimes

in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in squadron
in which rostov was serving division
in which several others joined but which bored pierre conversation
in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said conversation
in which the princes estate lay considered it his duty to province
in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful quiet
in which tikhon readily joined jokes

is a well known socalled sophism of the ancients consisting in there
is absurd come let go i tell you this
is again at our heels scoundrel
is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that it
is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us that
is all the rage just now he
is all very fine but things must be settled said prince this
is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in philanthropy
is alone and in full view of the emperor that
is alone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he he
is always cheerful satisfied and serene what wouldnt i give he
is always exciting especially to the young that
is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so chief
is always ready to descend upon the vanquished i must be clemency
is always related to the will of one or of several men who have it
is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put as
is always the case in an artillery company a head and shoulders as
is always the first thing that tells me all is well when i was it
is an alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it tugendbund
is an illness theres no other way of explaining it said it
is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his eh
is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that that
is as you know chiefly directed to political questions irritability
is at the approach of a longawaited moment he was firmly man
is awful and he burst into tears death
is bad father what
is being abandoned bald hills will be occupied by the smolensk
is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious she
is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others he
is better known to me the commander in chief than to him battle
is better than any of you exclaimed natasha getting up if he
is bezukhovas brother anatole kuragin she said indicating that
is brothers said he mother moscow the white his voice it
is called but in the fact that he alone understood the it
is called weak character do not seek a confidant in their what
is charming he has no sex he
is clearly defined for us people
is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsen buxhowden
is conceivable reason
is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of who
is continually receiving many petitioners one after another who
is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the man
is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humble this
is dangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving it
is dawn thought pierre but thats not what i want i want to it
is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one which
is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running it
is dolokhov asked kutuzov where
is dolokhov said prince andrew this
is done for he cried alpatych ill set the place on russia
is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger england
is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the it
is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and everything
is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite that
is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing he
is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of the he
is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may it
is dressed lovely and that stout one in spectacles is the she
is dunyasha name

is easy now to understand the significance of these events if it
is enough for me said sonya blushing that
is everything life is god everything changes and moves and life
is everything ready he added only tell me where to go and same
is evwything weady asked denisov bwing the horses well
is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people never
is exquisite when he discusses politics you should see his kuragin
is fathers way of treating religious subjects i dont andrew
is felt at every step of history unexpressed
is for boris from me for his outfit this
is for me stronger and higher than all else feeling
is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted that
is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a it
is for thee thus swells her heart it
is fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event expressed
is getting married and also from my husbands friend bolkonski he
is given to directing and commanding take less less part activity
is going as a cadet theres no one to interest himself for nicholas
is going away in a weeks time his papers have nicholas
is going on around them what
is going to the wars god knows when hell return marlborough
is good and kind and i am fond of him he thought of dessalles he
is good for humanity this assumption is all the more natural and what
is good that
is great it
is green already how early the birches and cherry everything
is happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant what
is he asked petya who
is he behaving himself and in general how
is he can i see him can i asked the princess where
is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man where
is he how
is he it is he nicholas said countess mary reentering it

is heroism it
is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and this
is impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first thing
is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov if he will not assist now
is in danger and any action finds a justification tranquillity
is in danger from general wintzingerodes reports i see that army
is in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind what
is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she there
is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign which
is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect god
is incalculable on his arrival in petersburg he received only gentry
is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event activity
is increased and diminished depend on three considerations necessity
is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most and
is it a holiday added
is it a petition what
is it all right ive invited some of the wounded into the papa
is it asked pierre what
is it asked someone in the porch who
is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her what
is it asked the person in the other room what
is it dear what
is it did he thank us came eager questions from all sides halt
is it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now why
is it he asked what
is it he said crossly and his hand shaking what
is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov how
is it late why
is it my dear come lets sit down here said she what
is it natasha said princess mary what
is it nicholas what
is it others see things and i dont she said you sit down why
is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces how
is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre but
is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me dance
is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him in
is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly how
is it she has not pride enough to see it if she has no pride how
is it some new relics asked prince andrew what
is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but saw where
is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war how
is it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no how
is it that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need how
is it tonight but i have to tell you what
is it true natasha asked looking attentively into pierres why
is it true that its peace and capitulation asked well
is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches pierre
is it well with thee he asked from time to time sonya
is it what
is it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment what
is it what has happened what
is it what is it he asked but his comrade was already what
is it what was that terror i felt of him what is this what
is it whats the matter what
is it where said pierre where
is it which is your house he asked which
is it who is it what is it for he kept asking what
is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment thought
is it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with say
is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing count
is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to man to why
is it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said he what
is it you are on foot and where are you going please how
is it you cousin ah
is it you didnt go head over heels asked the boldest of all how
is it you have got into your heads eh what are you what
is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old oh
is it you want he asked the commander in chief he was who
is it you were never at annettes the little princess asked why
is it you wish colonel i am at your service what
is itself a force producing events gervinus schlosser and power
is just made for a babys seat just look hand
is just the same as ever replied anna mikhaylovna he
is just this which alexander will feel most painfully i know him it
is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in a that
is killed rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back horse
is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had he
is life said the old teacher that
is life there is happiness there is much much before us i say there
is like he
is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but it
is lost we seized the children but not katie ooh o rest
is mans companion woman
is merciful birdie god
is merciful doctors are never needed she said god
is merciful god
is mere amusement else
is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other persons
is metempsychosis said sonya who had always learned well that
is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need not he
is mortally sick youll send the valet away and attend to father
is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary she
is much better than ours there
is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and ill this
is my niece said the count introducing sonya you dont this
is my refuge his will be done he exclaimed he
is my uncle your sewene highness he
is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a it
is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine it
is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of it
is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from he
is never observed by the universal historians and so to condition
is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what boris
is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many that
is no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an anatole
is no getting them together the army should push on before the there
is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a youth
is no more he
is no more sorrow or sighing but eternal joy and bliss there
is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist there
is no sense in anything i thought i was really serving my there
is not at all the thing he said what sort of polish this
is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to yours
is not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify it
is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german it
is not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by and
is not confirmed either by reason or by experience supposition
is not exhausted by the first the second or any of the processes bee
is not here and will never return he is not here for whom then is he
is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of it
is not quite well shes in her room and would like to natasha
is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to she
is not stupid she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she
is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should it
is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the he
is not too late yet your highness the enemy has not gone away it
is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a she
is nothing certain nothing at all except the unimportance of there
is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup there
is nothing to wait for and what is not ready ill send after there
is nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise and
is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkonski i it
is now necessary that man governed by his senses should find in it
is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for barclay
is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping that
is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile it
is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon russia
is one oak here
is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of men he
is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin she there
is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov there
is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule it
is only play the fact is that those men with whom you have present
is only possible when possible when we have quite abandoned the laws
is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkonski here
is our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there it
is out of place here no dont distress yourself outsider
is outrageous half the men have dispersed this
is over campaign
is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his all
is papa older she asked and
is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took that
is poor now and i am rich yes thats the only reason he
is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning that
is present cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left force
is present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of and
is presented to us by the historians as something great and army
is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a that
is pua as on the first day of cweation whos that now send one
is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes he
is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons previously
is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me she
is quite well again now isnt she julie asked pierre with a natalie
is ready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had it
is really and she is not at all so plain either she
is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and he
is returning to this capital and order is being tranquillity
is right on the other side this
is robbery youll answer for it sir said the infantry it
is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those it
is said to be the most capable of them all but i cannot say barclay
is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace that is he
is selfassured as being a citizen of the bestorganized englishman
is sensible well educated and goodnatured and the next hes a he
is she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to where
is she pretty ah friend my pink one is delicious her well
is she pretty he asked with a wink eh
is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the zakhar
is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a it
is so fond of he remembered his mothers love for him everyone
is so ill we women prince and she smiled tenderly always know he
is so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating she
is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever nothing
is so splendid she said how she understands children it mary
is so young and i thought that as my sons friend you daughter
is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it
is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise has here
is something i have received from the chancellor i asked him for here
is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites there
is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she there
is something up thought nicholas and he was further there
is sonya where
is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries there
is still much much before us he said as if with an old there
is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it there
is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break everything
is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the what
is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting how
is that frenchwoman blame
is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue who
is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not it
is that mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at here
is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had what
is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed locomotive
is that said different voices how
is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly would how
is that the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to thing
is that weally still going on asked
is thats what convinces that is what has convinced me there
is the army retreating or will there be another battle news
is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte it
is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions nothing
is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed power
is the commander in chief asked bolkonski where
is the commander in chief doing here he asked what
is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual how
is the creation of an allpowerful allgood and allseeing man
is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov my orders are to give here
is the dutch ambassador do you see that grayhaired man that
is the emperor embarrassed
is the emperor where is kutuzov rostov kept asking where
is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speak he
is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian such
is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly this
is the german for shelter what
is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put history
is the matter asked both the young and old rostov whwhat
is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and what
is the matter mary what
is the matter she asked what
is the matter with you my darling you look pale oh you are what
is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid what
is the more free the more abstract its interests and his which
is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain a where
is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the that
is the only thing left me not singing his thoughts ran on brain
is the peoples will he alone during the retreat of the french such
is the prince she asked how
is the princess he asked hiding where
is the real strength of the colony still exists and intangible
is the salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a which
is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing vereshchagin
is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners which
is the smolensk road acted simultaneously on him also that
is the something asked he what
is the sword of frederick the great which i she began but it
is the talk of all moscow my word i admire you it
is the talk of all moscow pierre asked angrily rising what
is the very essence of the soul and does not require an which
is the will of the people delegated to one person on condition
is theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so ours
is then at last that famous city it was high time it
is there a family free from sorrow now said pierre yes
is there a large force of you here said another a short man and
is there and silence seems like affectation they went speak
is there to be so caustique pleasure
is there to see said the assistant what
is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill what
is this but she does dance splendidly mazuwka
is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded what
is this the emperor does not look into anything he has petersburg
is this this he shouted and stood still commander whatever
is this thought nicholas listening to her with widely what
is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken case
is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all to dream
is to be done in a few months the year will be up the what
is to be happy with another kind of happiness the vocation
is to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate what
is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass he who
is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity animation
is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will thing
is to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no contrary
is too late now its done besides i love her thought pierre it
is transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite people
is true believe it it
is true that natasha is still young but so long as that it
is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh it
is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i never what
is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because it
is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged as
is very delicate dont tell natasha and dont attach health
is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real it
is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to count
is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor it
is very ill said pierre she
is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i he
is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer it
is very susceptible this return to the subject of natalie natalie
is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya he
is well but sad but do you know who rescued her it is she
is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa army
is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why that
is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is this
is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the this
is what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love this
is what the army authorities were reporting this
is what they have done with russia this is what they have this
is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added that
is what what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances this
is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the this
is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said that
is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number here
is with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina said that
is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune everybody
is worn out just you wait a bit vasilich

is your conception of freemasonry what
is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send where

island and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the an
island of madagascar she said madagascar she repeated the
islands amid black fields and stubble had become golden and green
islands amid the green winter rye the hares had already brightred
ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you another
isnt he i hear they will marry him to that rich girl handsome

isnt it kirilych

issued announcement
issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched been
it a favor that this man receives a daughter the caesars considers
it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neck so as not to send
it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a defend
it a sacred duty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wish consider
it about
it about
it about nicholas he asked is
it above his head cried waving
it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that whats
it all less than you do understand
it all lies in that get rid of falsehood and let war be seriously
it all the same not to send them isnt
it all up drink
it all wasnt it so your excellency and again timokhin get
it almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole made
it already abashed by this question i replied that sloth was know
it and again the women and men of weaker mold petya among them with
it and drew his attention to the verses with
it and fearing to be captured by the french on the way to krems find
it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him accept
it and he is so clever and so good said natasha dont you about
it and i ask you understand
it and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner recognize
it and leaving aside the question of moscow of the understood
it and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes say
it and the flight of the french without further conflicts is followed
it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the round
it and went into natashas room with it in her hand read
it and zeres an end of it and how do you a young man and a at
it anyhow escape
it as blameworthy regard
it as the resultant of the forces that is he has to recognize
it at
it at all like
it at that age train
it away tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman the little flung
it back bringing
it back in its place put
it be me thought rostov can
it be possible she thought not daring to look at his face can
it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas that
it because they alone knew what their life meant to them believe
it before i am in love my friend like
it before know
it behind
it below her waist held
it bent his head and told tushin that he could go prince credit
it but an hour tell me all you know about the will and above be
it but it was immpossible to get rid of them pull
it but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of in
it but with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she kiss
it by cries of anger and distress but his strength soon expressing
it by fumbling and that blindfold yes our body is just adjust
it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw dragging
it by the throat in a death grip a thousand times during seize
it by what he had already done in that direction if he renouncing
it came about that at the council at maloyaroslavets when the so
it came to natashas turn to choose a partner she rose and when
it can all be renounced which
it cannot be how happy i am but it cant be how happy i no
it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostov quits
it cant be avoided thought nicholas for the first and ah
it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field but
it cant be helped if they wont take less ah dear me i was yes
it cant be helped lad said the prince theyre all like no
it cant be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on service
it certain she said is
it come on i was sure of it began uncle he was thats
it come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone thats
it command
it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards found
it conceal
it concealing
it cost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame but
it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and answer
it decreed
it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it and
it disliked
it do
it do
it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it march
it does not weigh a hundredweight and wont break my neck if
it does thought pierre so
it doesnt matter said prince andrew tell countess well
it ever happen to you said natasha to her brother when does
it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject makes
it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him contrary
it felt damp and cold especially in clothes that were dispersing
it fetch
it fine eh uncle ignat said the boy suddenly beginning isnt
it fine when those germans gave us lifts you just sit still wasnt
it fits well platon kept repeating pulling the shirt see
it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young as
it for
it for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with refusing
it for this i nursed you ooh was
it for visitors youve got yourself up like that eh said is
it from
it from the cold asked someone was
it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular memorandum or but
it gently smiling with his lips only pulled
it goes without saying that one must be conscientious aquaintances
it gray or sometimes flabby its lack of a master a name called
it had been entrusted the more he realized the absence of all whom
it had been in august all was destroyed except something moscow
it had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different than
it had been necessary to do this and he received two believed
it had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight the if
it had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the halted
it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only regarded
it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should before
it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim when
it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg and
it happened how
it happened so chance created the situation genius because
it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not find
it has disagreed with me calls
it has happened luckily for you he said raising the open yes
it has hit he stopped and looked at the ranks no it has again
it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressing evidently
it he begged pierre to continue understand
it he exclaimed peremptorily theres a fight lads stop
it he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivanovich of
it he implored rostov to go on and prepare her survive
it he remembered the expression dolokhovs face assumed in believe
it he threw it on the table i have an old father and take
it here thats fine bring
it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased of
it his arguments were concise simple and clear recognize
it i cannot endure any more he said and left the understand
it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple take
it if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole say
it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations considered
it in doing so and threw it away an aidedecamp behind him tore
it in it seems hand
it in order not to sadden his dying father it is painful but hide
it in the holy science of our order all is one all is examine
it in their turn they continued what the french had plundered
it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises saying gives
it is
it is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness book
it is advantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially right
it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened so
it is all over and forever know
it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid yes
it is all very well for rostov whose father sends him attractive
it is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow of whom 2
it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew gentlemen
it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul grasp
it is and he looked round in the sleigh whatever
it is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible
it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of what
it is at least something to do excuse
it is better for me to come less often because no because
it is certain said the prince then
it is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a boldly
it is doing something for itself he submissively fulfilled the thinks
it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and precedes
it is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this ball
it is he yes that man is somehow closely and painfully yes
it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in that
it is impossible to stop them he reported and
it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of when
it is in your hands fate
it is it again said pierre to himself and an there
it is it is so
it is madness to buy anything in moscow now though
it is much more honorable to admit ones mistake than to let count
it is necessary that the first column marches the object
it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions when
it is not trained but it is a beautiful voice that must be said
it is not true that hes married then
it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and
it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to yet
it is past midnight cannot now be altered said he you have for
it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to so
it is possible to love someone dear to you with manifestations
it is really too late said count orlov looking at the camp oh
it is she is queen and her word is law as
it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come here
it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he yes
it is those who submit to the power but as the moral physically
it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and here
it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances and
it is thought the officer and he rode round the whole nuisance
it is time for bed night
it is true but by those who had abandoned it and not inhabitants
it is true had latterly spent whole days at home that is in who
it is true or not should make no difference to you whether
it is true yes
it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he yes
it is well for a people who do not as the french did in 1813 and
it isnt but
it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people destroy
it just sentimentality old wives tales or is she right he is
it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound nevertheless
it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the though
it laid across two barrels davout took the packet and read the on
it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand army before
it like
it logical isnt
it looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was staffs
it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the and
it made for crossing as by what took place at the arrangements
it matter count how the note is worded he asked so does
it mavra kuzminichna went to the gate open
it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of what
it means that he is kind noble and splendid and i could first
it means what does it mean out
it might be she did not know and this alarmed and tormented her what
it might happen he added with an involuntary smile marry
it might perhaps have been a long time before this allies
it might really have been so could one possibly make out amid perhaps
it might relate to public affairs or possibly to family concerns or
it moves me so is
it must be as my sovereign pleases but i cannot work with confidant
it must be done felt
it must be done now at that very moment or it would be too made
it must be exactly like the sample varnish sealing giltedged
it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to think
it must be in moscow look
it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the then
it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but not and
it myself well you know the count said the adjutant wrote
it natasha began again say
it natasha have you considered what these secret reasons can believe
it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that helena
it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was contemporaries
it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the considered
it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the considering
it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or perhaps
it negotiate an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal destroy
it never entered her head that the relations between him and that
it never entered my head and i wouldnt do that for their good least
it never entered their heads that it could have been apparently
it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it zeal
it no matter dagger will do he said to himself though reload
it no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a rode
it not against it youve filled your belly thats
it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very was
it not joseph alexeevichs face had looked young and comprehended
it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead situation
it occurred to natasha that he not wish to see her and sometimes
it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not and
it off but let it drop again the five minutes spent with his take
it off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare put
it on his coat and supported himself with it his frowning wiped
it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon facing
it on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging laid
it opened
it or allow it but i dont exact compensation either one cant order
it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and can
it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna told
it over and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence think
it over get into the barque and take care not to make it a think
it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes is
it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans that
it possible exclaimed anna mikhaylovna oh how awful it is
it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then is
it possible that i the chit of a girl as everybody called is
it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this is
it possible to forget said she is
it princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in repeated
it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples conquest
it raised
it really is bezukhov in a coachmans coat with a yes
it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into but
it right i have drunk a good deal but that is how i feel and saying
it right out or theyll think im holding on said dolokhov take
it rose and fell as
it said dolokhov though he did not seem to be even looking leave
it said he clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of about
it said nicholas got
it said she dropping her eyes shamefacedly about
it said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing is
it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically is
it says history utilized
it says plainly whosoever shall marry her that is but
it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts luminous
it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss that
it seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and reply
it seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as march
it seemed have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner would
it seemed not to matter whether all or only half the arrested
it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there effort
it seemed strange to him that his longfelt wish which had before
it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in entangled
it seemed to her that not only did everybody know that trepidation
it seemed to her that this difference arose from the sometimes
it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him ended
it seemed to him essential to see natasha in the evening he affair
it seemed to him that he was being fired at what what once
it seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a elated
it seemed to him the horses were not moving at all at last door
it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon which
it seemed to natasha go go said the mother sadly and coldly
it seemed to pierre that the french officers head had been torn and
it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him yes
it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie sorrow
it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this well
it seems to be all right pierre concluded and followed them
it seems to be getting quieter remarked ferapontov well
it seems to me so
it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you cant years
it seems to me that life is not over for him but realized
it seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel so
it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev lifted
it she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying sonya for
it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew describe
it shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that review
it should have had yet in spite of this your vow was significance
it should he will not bring in any plan of his own he will not as
it so lads isnt
it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha is
it sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it compressed
it sonya wait a bit sit here and natasha embraced understand
it sounded like speranski was distinctly ejaculating someone
it stood an aged stern and scornful monster among the fingers
it straight into her open heart divining the secret meaning of took
it strengthen
it suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge fired
it telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into of
it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns is
it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so is
it thats it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing his thats
it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening sheathed
it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible animate
it the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not of
it the other still more reasonably says that it is too escaping
it the question was no longer important in itself but discussed
it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for was
it then and since i could make only one movement at that lifting
it then his mother thought she loved him more much more than all in
it they also stepped on the raft on
it they spoke of their last meeting nicholas trying to about
it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do receiving
it to him then said anatole give
it to himself his faith in the right ordering of the acknowledge
it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans show
it to me said princess mary i know leave
it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of given
it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you give
it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high strapping
it to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk passed
it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhov is
it true that monsieur denisov has made you a proposal tell if
it turns out just at that moment a third enemy rises before us as
it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a lift
it under your head like a treasure said rostov i put it kept
it understood
it up made
it up myself they threatened and questioned him but he stuck made
it used to be so easy to live im pretty im young and i know which
it vasilich will put it away its not wanted leave
it was a bad business you
it was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she that
it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland and them
it was a ruble an arshin i suppose material
it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very said
it was a sunny morning and by eight oclock it was already business
it was a unique chance to show his devotion to the sovereign
it was a war of good sense for real interests for the times
it was all my fault and andrew was only joking offense
it was almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with forest
it was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually knew
it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and feeling
it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to business
it was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that there
it was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his buttons
it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth hunting
it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the and
it was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the three so
it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying secondly
it was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of it
it was clear that the others knew and pfuel himself expressions
it was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were earth
it was cold and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking smart
it was death i died and woke up yes death is an yes
it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why them
it was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his streets
it was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in notice
it was done by him by him alone reign
it was due to the power of some other person besides this that
it was ein mann zu sein vera at the same time smiling with a what
it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty empty
it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing wife
it was evident that kutuzov despised cleverness and propriety
it was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that head
it was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do and
it was firmly fixed on whether
it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her impossible
it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one prisoners
it was given to alpatych with instructions to hand it to the and
it was her relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not that
it was humiliating to look at the french rostov began shouting that
it was impossible because the military term to cut off thirdly
it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with secondly
it was impossible not to retreat a days march and then in the exist
it was in fact murat now called king of naples though naples
it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him time
it was inevitable but he could not make up his mind to take that
it was it was possible to drive out till
it was just that inner spiritual force that sincerity that but
it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the because
it was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow i
it was late at night they went out together into the street when
it was little mytishchi burning set on fire by mamonovs that
it was long before their conversation could settle on separation
it was much simpler really it was all very simple and but
it was napoleon his hero but at that moment napoleon seemed knew
it was natasha and he loved her possible
it was nearly noon though
it was not a council of war but as it were a difficulties
it was not accidentally natasha felt that he alluded acquaintances
it was not and could not be possible to explain the burning however
it was not clear what the artist meant to express by though
it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in it
it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to taken
it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for and
it was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the moscow
it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted that
it was now however impossible to get back the way he had house
it was of course out of the question for me to think of brother
it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by men
it was ours yesterday but now it is his redoubt
it was over the adjutant he had seen the previous day after
it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement whereas
it was plain that at that moment there was in natashas heart no them
it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened and
it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at headquarters
it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep inside
it was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and vulgar
it was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made yet
it was something something in the drawing room princess mary no
it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become society
it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service when
it was teteatete anatole continued still i cant though
it was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it today
it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or whether
it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always and
it was to get away difficult
it was to him that she now spoke and
it was useless to talk to the old man that he would never that
it was was as if he said to them i know you i know superiority
it weaken
it well are you coming with me he asked petya in
it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly if
it were it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to of
it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle if
it were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was if
it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that as
it were true that he has been beaten news would have come if
it which he nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained about
it while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so believe
it will be there i dont know but all will be well thought how
it will come out that youre already married why theyll that
it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to then
it will natasha answered reluctantly yes
it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no no
it with
it with
it with a cloth covered
it with remedies our body is like a perfect watch that encumbering
it with satisfaction because the selfsacrifice that fills recall
it wont be for long next summer ill take him to well
it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the fathers that
it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly whom
it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command personally
it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting woman oh
it would be imprudent to overresist them without an armed moment
it would be inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so why
it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was house
it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to sonya
it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on that
it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he living
it would have been senseless to block the passage of men secondly
it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own thirdly
it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the fourthly
it would not ache it would be well if only they did not breadth
it would only have been necessary for metternich consequently
it would still remain piteous and plain after two or three face
it yes lets say the others and off they go and take the take
it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly why you is
it youre not drunk today said nesvitski when the other had hows
it yourself know
italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way some
italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk the
italian singing master thats why shes ashamed natashas
italy his opponents reluctance to fight and his own childish to
its a fresh broadsheet oh
its a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three why
its a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly yes
its a sprain no
its all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the then
its all the same now pierre could not help saying but
its all very well but when a mans feet are frozen how can yes
its all very well for you you are pleased youve had a good yes
its all vewy well only not for those who get it in the warfare
its already ten but
its animation by love but she could not pray that her enemies and
its as you like said the staff captain and what has well
its awful she looked into her lovers face and saw in impossible
its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierres and
its bad he reflected but while he was thinking this father
its beard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with with
its cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed houses
its charm and they marched gaily some columns heightened
its charm now her face and body were of all that one saw constituted
its course evening passed night came and the feeling of continued
its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a have
its dull formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre with
its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting twitched
its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shouting pricking
its edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon on
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its with
its first period had passed when the partisans themselves october
its flight begin
its from julie replied the princess with a timid glance and yes
its goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim moscow
its gods will you must be prepared for everything princess
its gray mane which though he saw other faces as well he had with
its habitual calm and firm appearance assumed
its halting place by the dam of a small pond it was past one at
its head lower it he said to a soldier who had lower
its head to face her and instead of putting on speed as she turned
its horrible vile inhuman to take advantage of the breaking
its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite but
its impossible see what is going on in the yard she mamma
its impossible to do anything here thought rostov no
its in my ears but perhaps its music of my own well forward
its inconvenient please dont said berg only i so wanted if
its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else see
its joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was expressing
its joys is open to me said he to himself and for the first all
its just as i thought said rostov to himself he there
its magical isnt it natasha
its message out to thee sighing
its nasty work an attacks pleasant work hacking away at the and
its nations through napoleons louises and writers but we directing
its nearly ten oclock answered natashas voice a late
its nostrils and kissing it sniffing
its not he how can you talk such nonsense no
its not possible he cried aloud no
its not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in no
its not that but worse you will see o mary he is too no
its not that i never leave off loving you and one couldnt no
its not true ha
its nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeat a oh
its only indigestion say its only indigestion say so no
its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as no
its our turn to begin enchanting
its own part and before it had finished the melody merged with played
its own particular tone the largest of these was the french with
its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite and
its paw and let go of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment open
its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression by
its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem perceive
its queer he added after a pause that you should acquaintance
its red halo was still burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay with
its scabbard and flourishing it from
its sides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames of
its significance if he tries to realize it his efforts understands
its small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and in
its strange friends continued the man who had wondered at but
its such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it you
its swollen lips was more than plain it was dreadful but with
its tail between its legs and darted aside yells and tucked
its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same of
its teaching not in words only but also by other means which delivers
its teeth with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or uses
its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power oh
its the chorus from the watercarrier listen and natasha no
its the devil knows what knew
its the saute most likely she added with a smile waistcoat
its the state of affairs perhaps
its the steam that spoils them he added stretching out foot
its time for supper and here are the gypsies supper
its time to begin he whispered and taking up his glass he toasts
its tolerable said he but with bagration on the left here
its too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army events
its too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it today
its true he has been reinstated but how could they fail through
its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon but
its useless because
its usual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sob had
its very hard condition
its walls under
its wetched well what are you standing there for you oh
its wheels squeaking over the snow natasha and sonya theater
its womanly beauty all

its you very glad very glad to see you he said however ah

lifeless attitude very familiar to him in which petyas unmistakably

military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the but
military or not that it was here the french should attack it anyone
military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone a
military rank corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom higher
military science to say this is like defining momentum in for

military writers and following them others consider this flank why

nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious but
nobody was right or wrong the future held nothing and there was that
nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room the
nodded and walked away napoleon
nodded and went on with what he had been saying when the pierre
nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naively mikhaylovna
nodded assent napoleon
nodded her head with a happy smile who
nodded in answer to balashavs low and respectful bow and coming he
nodded sonya
nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a box
nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied she
nodding to the aidedecamp said

noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her marya dmitrievna with

noses and new conditions of life will arise which will seem their
not a cheerful one dunyasha who went with her in the carriage was
not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said petya im
not a hairs breadth farther answered prince vasili exactly
not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer that
not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is was
not a single muscle of his face which in those days was still valley
not a single tooth or hair remained when
not a word about some denisov or other though he himself
not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously could
not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but could
not acknowledge such a power and therefore before speaking about do
not afraid of anything said sonya may i go at once she im
not afraid to extend his line but he welcomed every step napoleon
not agree with his limited understanding of what is good whether does
not all the columns have formed up yet your majesty waiting
not and never did like speranski personally but i like justice do
not angry with me for coming you have changed so andrusha are

not as they generally prepared for it in the rostov sacrament
not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country youre
not asked natasha in a frightened tone why
not asleep natasha jumped up snatched up her slippers youre
not assume that pose which would have made her ridiculous could
not at all as i ran thought prince andrew not as we ran solemn
not at all bad that little companion i hope she will bring her her
not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up and its
not at all make out was it a glade in the wood lit up by the could
not at all understand so others are even more afraid than i could
not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances did were
not at first understand him at length when he had understood could

not at pierre but straight before him and turning the looking
not at the cavalry which had disappeared but at french firing

not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty polish would
not be a manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed would
not be able to equip him shall
not be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten would
not be called wars they did not accord with the theory and could
not be discovered from the shevardino redoubt could
not be displeased at this excess of zeal would
not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the should
not be happy before natasha had finished singing would
not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all would
not be otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and could
not be responsible for what might happen on the evening of could
not be sure what change there was in his face all she could see could
not be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she would
not be understood or approved by her husband would

not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from but
not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts but on them
not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what listened
not only would the count never be able to find out whether all that

of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients its charge
of throwing her brother and natasha together amused her idea
of till now thinking
of time and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless limits
of time anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and most
of time your excellency muttered kutuzov in the midst plenty
of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask weariness
of transports and the guerrilla war were all departures seizure
of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the method
of troops were bearing down on them from behind and an masses
of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor was flag

of unheardof losses of the loss of half the army and a another

of unlimited power in time when they grow more traditions
of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have possibilities
of untidiness and neglect of herself she now added qualities

of visitors and the soft steps of the footmen at one end of voices
of vladimir and anna and he still filled the quiet and orders
of vodka the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs ration

of voice of those who were reporting by long years of military tone
of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french in sound
of voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud sound
of waiting prepare for the war all the efforts of those who tired
of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still habit
of war a plan again one of pfuels had been devised to catch seat

of what a fugue is each instrument now resembling a conception
of what afraid
of what had happened he alone then understood the significance
of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could spoke
of what pleased the sovereign disadvantage
of what they were doing though they would have been glad to horror
of what to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself question
of what was good and bad only when he had understood the judgment
of what was happening in home and foreign affairs knowledge
of what was happening kutuzov seems to them something importance
of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the him
of what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking only
of what will follow cause
of wheels on the cobblestones and the brilliant hot rattling
of whether it was right or wrong to show fear snorted regardless
of which had even then filled him with horror as by a sight
of which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that freedom
of which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya uniform
of which he was unable to judge circumstance
of which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after affairs
of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump middle
of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious hopelessness
of which was not clear to him to question his chief purpose
of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much one
of which with the masses needs explanation it is connection
of which without taking in a word she understood only anatole
of whips shouts the urging of horses and the swearing of crack
of whom austria has so many and to lay down all this heavy general
of whom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of one
of whom he had heard from pierre his love for natasha karataev
of whom he had just been thinking natasha
of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a thought
of whom set off to the neighboring villages or returned from crowds
of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings men
of whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of causes
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on gust
of winter on entering the forest the horses began to snort reminder
of wounded pride and a hope of glory and should there be feeling
of years ago that same law of necessity which with such thousands
of years the peasants of borodino gorki shevardino and hundreds
of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he quarrel
of you and of myself people

once he has become acquainted with them but the same impermeability
once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no at
once more entered into the definite conditions of this having
once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew just
once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so passionately
once or twice from side to side over
once or twice within a twelvemonth and then he would go and himself
once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance to the palace at
once recalled it but now it seemed to him that that meeting even
once tears rose to her eyes and to those of monsieur de jobert than
once this instant no it cant be she thought at
once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed at
one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed this
one adjutant nearest the door was sitting at the table clavichord
one admit that intellectual activity controls peoples actions can
one after another and a third reports
one after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now rose
one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had that
one and it is even more difficult to understand just why profound
one and princess bolkonskaya another is
one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking by
one and the same thing a hundred times remarked to his repeated
one and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom no
one another all the faces expressed hesitation and the slaughter
one another and corresponding to the event its justification kill
one another and injured their souls their eternal souls tormented
one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and interrupting
one another as before confronted
one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past encounter
one another both smiling with selfsatisfaction and each mentally at
one another but the regiments both cavalry and infantry offending
one another for their lack of confidence reproving
one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of to
one another in a world of indifferent people understood
one another none of them capable of injuring another and so loving
one another sire mon cousin prince deckmuhl roi de called
one another such innumerable crimes frauds treacheries against
one another that the larger number take a more direct share toward
one another to
one another to try ilyins horse raced

one another yelling and puffing slapping
one another you two and ill look on against
one anothers prices to below what they had been in former down
one answered no
one at a time and shaking them pillows
one at last begins to remember what happened before one memories
one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times can
one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street and no
one can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are than
one can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long how
one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the but
one cant doubt him one cant one cant dont you sonya
one cant hear them theyd be firing if we had no
one cant unmarry dont be afraid i wont tell anyone but you that
one case they say platov took poleon himself twice but he only
one command and in a like order under
one community without distinction of class without enmity as
one contradicted him no
one could not disregard oneself and ones own family so catastrophe
one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit that
one could touch it with ones hand that
one day at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign barclay
one day closing his eyes and fingering pierres elbow vasili
one dearest princess mary could not quite make out what dear
one die like a dog said he must
one dividing into many each drop tried to spread out and sometimes
one do without government or else there would be plenty whod rob can
one do you want maamselle said he screwing up his which
one draught or he loses shouted a fourth at
one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do no
one end of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other pulling
one enormous mass six miles long in
one evening the rostovs four sleighs drove into marya late
one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he pierres
one firstly twofold
one from our sutler he has splendid things and hes very capital
one gave any reply no
one general an important personage evidently feeling arakcheev
one get a book he asked couldnt
one god is above us both vereshchagins words suddenly count
one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have been only
one had a husband living they did not discuss for that question while
one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but no
one had put but which was always in her mind and how much no
one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt the
one has to be cunning and cruel world
one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer all as
one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret troubles
one he knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it the
one heard curses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind everywhere
one horse in their service more than once they had beaten him than
one in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a gallop
one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would given
one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyin on seeing the
one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble no
one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the yes
one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to no
one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening number
one knee he twirled her round him and again jumping up dashed on
one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a guns
one love and what hate what does one live for and what am should
one man and another pleased him and drew from him an amused between
one man said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other camp
one man shouted
one mass and supplied them with a certain energy there was into
one may hinder him under any pretense 3 sunday and wednesday no
one might kill and rob and yet be happy nonsense
one miserable horse he can do no good either for himself or only
one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory at
one moment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that at
one more charming in society ah here she is yes she is still no
one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under well
one morning and with a pleasant smile respectfully asked his early
one must forget and understand and going to his bed married
one must harness it is time to harness yes
one must harness them must harness them he repeated to himself yes
one must think of the future of all of you i love everything
one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible contrary
one need not be ashamed of his being a widower mamma
one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans yet
one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see late
one noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back that
one oclock at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle after
one of gods chosen hes a benefactor he once gave me ten rubles is

one of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperor and
one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole into
one of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road merrily
one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle and
one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in least
one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished when
one of the generals espied him and hearing what he had come but
one of the least significant parts of the field it
one of the men like a child of
one of the men said
one of the most zealous cuttersoff and chichagov
one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice ah
one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold not
one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded at
one of the second guns crew was uncle tushin looked at number
one of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and body
one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with fury and
one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just dolgorukov
one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms separating and
one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of not
one of them of
one of them said something strange not in russian in among behind
one of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles during
one of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if during
one of these projects but even that he cannot do events and choose
one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to courtiers
one of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair to
one of which the event could not have taken place it was any
one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on his from
one only wonders at the longsuffering or blindness of the before
one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation and from
one out of the other in the childrens presence drew
one pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sitting
one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the commanded
one replied a word to dolokhovs laughter and a french officer no
one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd no
one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully crossed no
one replied to his remarks no

one side raising his arm and fell on his chest several to

one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and there
one that will result from it will be as victorious however the

seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror when
seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and like
seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room did not yet
seeing anything for an instant but there was no second report as from
seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber but
seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still and
seeing her guilty expression put his other arm around her and and
seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess marys pace on
seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose went
seeing prince andrew ran into the house alpatych having sent boy
seeing russians unexpectedly before them sometimes rushed suddenly
seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some heard
seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to and
seeing that the french troops were running onto the sergeant
seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers on
seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased on
seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now but
seeing the impression the of her brothers wound produced natasha

seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than duties
seem he
seem logical and convincing may
seem odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and it
seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy would
seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this would
seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who may
seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually suddenly
seem very good and serious people fill whole volumes to orders
seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino only
seemed a man from another world and for a long time natasha he
seemed as if from some words boris had spoken that evening it
seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words it
seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed it
seemed as it were hardened by a varnish left by the thousands helene
seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be now
seemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was talking to the pierre
seemed familiar to rostov and involuntarily riveted his figure
seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and he
seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it immobility
seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its time
seemed most important to the cossacks horses saddles what
seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and they
seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after had
seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general kutuzov
seemed quite natural but on the other hand all her previous now
seemed simple and natural everything
seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the everything
seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the men
seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it it
seemed strange to be so near him to look at him like that to be it
seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid it
seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to she
seemed to be in the future but in the past all the longer
seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but it
seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the still
seemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a something
seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 the old son
seemed to have forgotten petyas very existence he turned denisov
seemed to have shriveled or melted his features had grown face
seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen it
seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically it
seemed to her the acme of musical delight moment
seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in warfare
seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so moment
seemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as philanthropy
seemed to him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard guns
seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this there
seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a restricted
seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and it
seemed to him that it was getting lighter to the left he saw a it
seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to it
seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the always
seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking it
seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince it
seemed to pierre it
seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant it
seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this it
seemed to princess mary it
seemed to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of hush
seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked napoleon
seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as girl
seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished he
seemed widespread everywhere the cooks moans had now subsided which
seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur it
seems as much alive as other hives it
seems funny to me said pierre that you you should it
seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he it
seems less heavy rain
seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have it
seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors it
seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as it
seems they say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove it
seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known to history
seems to be that you cant love me that i am so plain it
seems to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my action
seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views it
seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the distance

she could not understand them however much she might think that
she could not write because she could not conceive the obligation
she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody that
she could see her again when
she could see only one solution namely for nicholas to marry view
she covered her face with her hands and
she cried as a child does because her nose had to be lungs
she cried holding out her hand to him what are you wonderful
she cried understand
she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of so
she did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing which
she did not answer about
she did not finish leave my room she exclaimed and weakness
she did not in the least understand but to which she which
she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come men
she did not know whether she liked it or not she even solitude
she did not remember what she had said and that she had no that
she did not reply but looked at her seriously things
she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad that
she did not understand agitated her she said nothing but which
she did not understand in horror at her own vileness simply when
she did not understand them and she always dreaded being a though
she did not yet sing well as all the connoisseurs who heard her but
she did these things not under any external impulse as people liver
she disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor pilgrimage
she doesnt like me said natasha but
she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other what
she drew her brothers attention to the maid who was prevailed
she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely foresaw
she drove them away and tried to conceal them imagination
she either doesnt understand or is pretending thought no
she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of as
she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately isnt
she feared to recall for her own sake which
she fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know virtuous
she fell into one of the mad merry moods characteristic sometimes
she felt even more sad but it was a sweet tender sadness pretty
she felt guilty if
she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her after
she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she confusion
she felt sorry for herself sorry that she was being wasted master
she felt that from her she would be able to understand and natasha
she finished quickly please
she formed a definite plan of action just as boris leave departure
she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the first
she found it dull packed
she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement distress
she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she if
she got frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her but
she grew pale on seeing her fatherinlaw maid
she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about once
she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to moscow
she had been stopped a second time by uncles borzois when
she had been the day before but that day as he looked at her than
she had been used to from childhood and unable to conditions
she had begun before her must i break off with him must i letter
she had begun looking after him he had always experienced since
she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his where
she had completed the tour of the garden which brought her when
she had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it which
she had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a as
she had fallen asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister crying
she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously bezukhova
she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and formerly
she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak before
she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectly which
she had forgotten her age and by force of habit apparently
she had gone a dressmaker from madame suppertroguet waited after
she had had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration feeling
she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the details
she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen face
she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take once
she had never felt till that moment she ran out sobbing thought
she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look him
she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes and listening to the toe
she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of these
she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she parties
she had received from paris and advised natasha to have one which
she had said it and they all felt awkward why
she had seen her guests out when
she had seen what
she had served up was received with pleasure by all her novelty
she had stealthily procured after swallowing a little she had arsenic
she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more twenty
she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how
she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the shop
she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt when
she had then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and man
she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink that
she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket when
she had to endure and love and that she did people
she had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so what
she had worn him out had caused his quarrel with his son had her

she has no one no one to tell the truth i dont need her pitied
she has said once
she held in her hand all i know is that his real will is portfolio
she held what
she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not moment
she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the intriguer
she immediately invented a reason for going down and unconsciously
she invited nicholas to come to moscow inclination
she is an angelic being ah boris boris she paused and how her
she is here still said prince andrew and prince then

she is so you know unpleasant but my intelligence

she is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be no
she is very unfortunate added anna pavlovna deserves
she joined the other young ladies in begging natasha and harp
she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him suddenly
she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives she sobbing
she knew so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from which
she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible him
she knew that it sprang from pierres whole soul but it because
she knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer and she it
she knows i am engaged and she and her husband pierre that so
she laughed at the other could be heard the story of the which
she led him to the house offered him lunch and sat down with him
she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all only
she lifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said her
she like him thought natasha yes like and yet not like but is
she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them how
she listened to every word about the victory of moses over strongly
she looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to him
she looked straight before her all that night she did not eyes
she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that that
she loved him she need only say the word yes and no human power if
she loved in the arms of the man she loved nicholas also boy
she loves me and you like that well
she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now how
she marry he thought to be unhappy for certain theres should
she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her as
she moved forward started
she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all and
she murmured natasha
she must love him if she could so far forget herself passionately
she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly mamma
she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an as
she nearly knocked our gentlemans hat off cried the oh
she needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though handkerchief
she needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been danger
she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow tears
she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she but
she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she himself
she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary had
she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look request
she not only saw no need of any other or better husband but as and
she noticed at once that something had happened to him ask
she now had no one to write to since julie whose presence that
she now keeping pierre close beside her entered the room even lady
she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always when
she offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a novelty
she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said but
she only took his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of so
she opened the door and the bright daylight in that thought
she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and that
she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could occasions
she overtook her in the sitting room as
she paused no one broke the silence again
she prayed for the members of her own family her father and us
she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul how
she prepared to listen prince
she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him society
she put showed pierre that she understood just what he questions
she ran across the street turned down a side street to the left her
she ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her friend
she ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight that decorations
she read she glanced at the sleeping natasha trying to find in as
she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no what
she received petitioners of various classes of whom there dressing
she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and her
she remembered the light failing through that crack once before that
she repeated again dearest
she replied and with thee yes
she replied but she had not understood his question no
she replied you have done splendidly yes
she resolved to become a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone that
she rose to go to her own room as
she said
she said again speaking as some third collective male is
she said almost with tears in her voice there never never sonya
she said and i will go and tell her it is no use either
she said appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of once
she said do not turn away from me let us weep together father
she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess it
she said just audibly natasha
she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enter happen
she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her yes
she said moving away from the embroidery frame and lying mary
she said pierre
she said regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who dronushka
she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that married
she said so
she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again when
she said this the countess looked round at her daughter as
she said threateningly cossack
she said timidly after a moments silence i have a andrew
she said timidly drawing princess marys hand to herself mary
she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a vera
she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the boris
she said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs me
she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes were
she said turning to her brother as if asking him what nicholas
she said with the facility in lying natural to a society you
she sat down to show him the french alphabet she so longed to hand
she saw natashas fright sonya shed tears of shame and pity when
she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one bennigsen
she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him when
she says its very fine prayer
she screamed at her brother and running to a chair idiot
she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little arms
she seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he him
she set off at a run along the passage and
she should not speak french so much its not the time for it countess
she should rouse the dozing baby lest
she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of then
she smiled her ecstatic smile and
she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her me
she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed as
she spread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed and
she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on finished
she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trust but
she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time that
she stood by her mothers side and exchanged nods with anyone
she struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and pretty
she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments reflections
she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true sonya
she thinking about why is she so glad is
she thought as she got into her carriage simple
she thought glancing at that curledup sleeping little sonya
she thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not not
she thought when she reflected on the change but when she soon
she told her how he had complimented her how he told her he her
she told him she loved another pause
she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details morning
she told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because arrival
she too had doubts about this marriage soul
she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to isnt
she took no pains with her manners or with of speech or seductive
she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself clearness
she turned away from the glass making an effort not to cry and
she turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her said
she used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to which
she used to say often seeing the success she had with promener
she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern said
she waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and it
she was alone and after that often came again when
she was already but that was enough she exhaled happiness and than
she was always imagining that it always seemed to her that but
she was dancing with a grownup man who had been abroad she happy
she was fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way how
she was going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing it
she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from it
she was holding in her reticule so you promise what
she was horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after andrew
she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society as
she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i that
she was knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to stocking
she was lying her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear which
she was more agitated than ever when they got home natasha was dinner
she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the but
she was not pleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it that
she was now saying she had talked of before with tears what
she was one of those women mostly mothers who having once made that
she was ready to sacrifice everything happiness
she was right he thought remembering what the governors sonya
she was simply looking at him whether
she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider background
she was so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of when
she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and rose
she was the countess bezukhova pierres wife and the smiled
she was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time till
she was with him and he was looking at her with a lovers eyes when
she was wont to do when natasha was ill then touched her as
she well my quarters are at your service is
she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and and
she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag of
she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal far
she went on with a smile at her own enthusiasm we belong to world
she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and spirit
she went to natashas room fingering the key in her pocket midnight
she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead hand
she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in listless
she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess if
she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and dunyasha
she whispered goliath
she wished to devote her whole life to him how
she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of him
she wished to make up for lost time selfrestraint
she wont be dancing here a month before she will be that
she would be the last to quit petersburg concerned
she would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave that
she would go to the nursery to nurse petya her only boy no one and
she would like to be married to all three at the same time squarely
she would not let him and having closed the door behind him but

shed full of animation but on seeing prince andrews face he felt the
shed he had stayed in the shed where he was first put officers

simple and kindly people the old counts hospitality excellent
simple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind seemed
simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in the
simple but now alone by herself it was incomprehensible and
simple enough thats

simple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep their
simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of than
simple they do not talk but act the spoken word is silver but are
simple you see i dont say that we ought to oppose this and and
simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the the

simplicity
simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary man

since the time when he thought his son had been killed noticeable
since the world began and men have killed one another no one one
since then and until evening the party had the movements of road
since then the government property had been removed every night and

snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head and
snow a purpleblack and starry sky showed itself and the frost falling
snow becomes remaining
snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself the
snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor the
snow on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the the
snow the
snows maintained the life of this original peculiar and unique the
snubnosed face with its high cheekbones and baring his white swarthy
snuffbox which he took gold
so absorbed that he did not understand what was said was
so actively in hand saved her for a while from her grief and took
so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and were
so alien to us was
so and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the said
so and that they must stop this and the carts must be got them
so anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul do
so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the why
so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to petya
so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind distance
so as peacefully to fulfill thy will and scarcely had she fancies
so as to avoid active service the old prince and his recruitment
so asked pierre why
so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dog is a very good why
so asked rostov how
so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived privations
so brother he continued with a smile on his pale and
so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten and
so but we must know what troops they are and their thats
so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative saying
so carried away by passion oh only my poor mother being
so close that the expression of his face could be seen and already
so comforted her were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words then
so contented and happy with him i only wish you were all as am
so contrary to his method of conducting war believe me he is is
so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook sobbing
so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i cant was
so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole night
so dearly and distinctly indicated society
so detested rode up while kutuzov was at dinner wolzogen bagration
so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy after by
so dull it has been a delightful evening has it not hippolyte
so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet comprehend
so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched was
so early and so well or got so good a return as did harvested
so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner they
so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to dropped
so far from home that he accepted uncles offer that the were
so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily portfolio
so flabby that they looked heavier below were twitching were
so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of was
so for fear princess mary should ask her father to give his done
so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the and
so free so lighthearted and i did not realize how happy i happy
so frightened feel
so frightened that she woke sonya and told her what she had done been
so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my be
so good shouted the captain frowning angrily be
so goodnatured and her position now is a very hard one sweet
so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began he came
so happy laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a been
so he had come to petersburg to look for one and also as he post
so he is quite blind and
so high i always said only
so i pray god to have you my friend in his holy and powerful and
so in the crowd people began talking loudly to stifle their doing
so insurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused appear
so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the yes
so it was best to be silent but after a while just as a jury and
so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided and
so it was in sonyas place sat natasha who had just come in and
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give were
so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she just
so kutuzov who evidently understood his case and wished him and
so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as see
so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but words
so long well come along now quick quick its time you two away
so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise laughter
so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had not
so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars which
so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however always
so many emotions that for a long time past those memories experienced
so many relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well has
so many that thered have been a heap of them killed
so morose and irritable count
so much afraid that his heart stood still his hand hussars
so much appreciated by everyone the other day at the known
so much money that never does any harm thought anatole has
so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her looks
so my pet how
so near to you and to all your family that i thought you would come
so nicholas rostov as was natural to him felt contented with the be
so no but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he done
so not one of the orders in the disposition was or could napoleon
so now the smile of the little princess influenced by the come
so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him comfort
so on but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and and
so on even those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing and
so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the and
so on the officer sends for auersperg these gentlemen embrace and
so on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs and
so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of be
so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes pretty
so remembered everything and everybody at last and last and had who
so said the cossack just
so serious though she was still holding the ends of her were
so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the yet
so softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him pierre
so straight its well god had mercy on us and what was it for shoot
so strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and was
so swiftly had he ducked it off
so than nicholas but had never learned music or thought about more
so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides civilization
so that everyone could hear deliberately
so that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous men
so that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted pressed
so that he should look into hers rather than this but looking eye
so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its turned
so that his voice rang far through the rooms shouted
so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm oh
so that it closed over his head water
so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live but
so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to armies
so that the greater the conception of necessity the regarded
so that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared in
so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent crossed
so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of money
so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i matters
so thats finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have well
so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had and
so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict speaking
so the soldiers after a twentymile march were kept mending enough
so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the regiment
so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack free
so theres no need for me to marry him but just so just
so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating and
so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken and
so this is how we meet again he of spoke of you even at the hand
so this is the battle of pultusk which is considered a great does
so this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did beauty
so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of and
so to me because sonya is poor i must not love her he speak
so to say have now assembled in council no one knows what leaders
so truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the opinion
so variously understood by the historians themselves is really force
so when everybody laughed loudly at it done
so when i see him him
so why did i hurry nicholas began to settle down in his old same
so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of and
so you are one of us soldiers he added smiling after a ha
so you are pwince andwew bolkonski he swayed his head vewy neck
so you are still at that silly business quickly closed remarking
so you had to go through that too and
so you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly and
so you see i never told this to anyone and never everything
so you still love me my romantic julie separation of which delight
so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked and
so youll give her the packet goodby
so your excellency all they have to do is to eat a good thats
so youve had him educated abroad prince vasili havent you and
soandso was dead and soandso was married which she would that
sobbed kuzmich tears and from all sides was smothered in he
sobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for day

sobs of a woman and the hoarse angry shouting of despairing
sobs stifled

succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince had
success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them the
success there were many pretty girls and the rostov girls great
successful shot and the cry of stretchers was heard most of a
such a base thing as money and because their youth was over about
such a capital fellow as bezukhov in natashas eyes especially
such a chance way and attaching him to himself what if he gave just
such a chicken anywhere anisya fedorovna left the room or
such a clumsy modest fellow could have played such a prank on a how
such a degree that many of them came up to her stared her in the to
such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and of
such a lovely night before was
such a man to
such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a at
such a moment said pierre reproachfully at
such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new and
such a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be known out
such a quantity of churches why
such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew answer
such a subordinate by me have
such a such a never happened to me before she said but
such a thing as other peoples happiness and peace and that you is
such a thing never happened to me before she said mummy
such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the in
such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she to
such an extent to
such and they remained silent while the majority were interested many
such as are a burden to themselves and to others are left or
such as cloth and receiving in payment a half of what they goods
such as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides surroundings
such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them just
such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long smile
such as she are rare here he thought as natasha married
such as were depicted in his plutarch were leading a huge helmets
such as where would he live was he going to rebuild trifling
such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter connection
such efforts the enemy had fled experienced a similar feeling of of
such faith in natasha seemed to sonya terrible well anyway had
such feelings in others and if never having felt them i understand
such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity on
such gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the just
such had european life politics freemasonry philosophy and and
such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors altogether
such honor to bagration was the best way of expressing paying
such ill luck as soon as you left it began and went on luck
such justification there would be no reply to the simplest without
such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain thats plain what to
such love as sonya was speaking of but natasha had not yet felt was
such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and stuff
such men nowadays and which of us has not weaknesses of his meet
such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france and
such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work at
such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in at
such music of
such pathetic words to the son or pierre whom it had been spoken
such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief untimely
such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all denisov said
suddenly
suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him those and
suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging puff
suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a had

suddenly blushing added
suddenly changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed day
suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to faces
suddenly cried out in joyful surprise past
suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much petya stopped and then
suddenly fell on his knees dron
suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate nicholas
suddenly find that we are not in otradnoe but in fairyland and and
suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to pierre
suddenly flushed natasha
suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single denisov
suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands pelageya
suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail then
suddenly he saw vividly before him a longforgotten kindly and
suddenly heavy slanting rain came down then
suddenly helene who was getting bored said with one of her but
suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a princess
suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry and
suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin then
suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from the saying
suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning and
suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some then
suddenly made friends with him but in 1811 they again quarreled he
suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity she
suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were had
suddenly replied in french pierre
suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she she
suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away lifted her music tears
suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his pierre
suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug and had died in had
suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to and
suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and prince and
suddenly there stood and
suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was and
suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who frowning

suffering and wished to say something but what it was no one was
suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if without

than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling less

than among others one instance which had occurred some noticeable
than an hour to do so and came out upon the square where the more
than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german typical

than anyone else prince vasili took possession of pierres more
than anything else in pierres story the captain was more

than five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing a more
than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash more
than gratuitous selfsacrifice and therefore seems comprehensible
than he did he found that this was the body of a man set better
than he had ever before shown himself angry

thank me for youll

thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again i
thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and well
thank you princess he added softly sometimes it is hard why
thank your serene highness but i fear i am longer fit for the i
thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests having
thanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to rostov
thanks dear friend for the volume you have sent me and thousand
thanks old fellow but the bits left over said the thanks

that a certain definite dependence exists between the two but
that a courtmartial had been appointed and that in view of the turn
that a longfrocked abbe was brought to her she confessed after
that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should argued
that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might remark
that a passing officer should joke with them flattered
that a stone falls downwards a man indubitably believes this argument
that absentminded crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no was
that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the hindered
that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was this
that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy with
that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself yes
that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak turns seeing
that all men though they understand nothing and are supposed
that all natashas outbursts had been due to her need of realized
that all our maneuvers are useless everything is being said
that all the generals expressed the same wish could no longer fact
that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that be
that all those small events were inevitable clear
that all would happen according to plan and therefore himself
that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for remembered
that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont like
that and knew that he was now even more experienced and knew
that and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never but
that anisya fedorovna who had at once handed her the precision
that anna pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the after
that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational but napoleon
that army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two of
that arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she feeling
that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the and
that as a duck is so made that it must live in water so convinced
that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got out whos
that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne noticed
that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him knowing
that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the clear
that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the at
that battery led the french to suppose that here in the center of
that battle accepted
that besides military matters social interests and the fair indicate
that best count hey are you dumb he shouted still i not
that bezukhov was in orel willarski though they had hearing
that blackspotted one of yours is fine well shaped breadth
that boris had overheard it displeased
that borodino was a victory despite the assurance of generals death
that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and so
that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her petersburg
that boy in the furlined coat had turned upon him but i reproach
that bright evening of august 25 prince andrew lay leaning on on
that brought salvation might have proved disastrous march
that but consider the position in which you are placing her into
that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable so
that by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for afraid
that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the supposing
that came into her head but what she had invented then seemed thing
that came into his mind was that today he had to be thought
that came to him imaginings
that can be bought but think what being left behind means to things
that cant be no
that cant happen twice eh said anatole with a well
that case began willarski but pierre interrupted him in
that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack in
that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at your in
that casket for mammas name day and then going home i was so buy
that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to showing
that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners to
that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother of
that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen lead
that column in
that comes to hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine cudgel
that comes with years people talked about him were serenity
that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling however
that confusion what did or did not happen all
that connection with him was no such great honor after bolkonski
that constant composure and complacency and lack of understanding
that constitutes mens happiness the comforts of life everything
that could happen they went away even before the battle of thing
that could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he discussions
that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is oh
that count rostov had called the princess showed no confusion room
that count wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as vyazma
that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and cloak
that covered his boots now he took big strides trying to keep to dust
that cried alpatych sternly i see through you and three stop
that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesvitski hearing
that curled up from the rotating black ball i cannot i do not smoke
that curtseying there cadet miwonov thats not wight whos
that daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well well
that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only from
that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew from
that day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat better
that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that all
that day but no sooner had natasha finished her barcarolle than did
that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to disturbed
that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince on
that day i received a letter from my benefactor in which he bright
that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he all
that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostovs as from
that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the all
that days encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than but
that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the knowing
that dinner was ready the door opened and from the announced
that direct course and not finding itself pursued was naturally from
that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently from
that dolokhov the brawler dolokhov the bully lived in moscow learned
that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against one when
that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the put
that drawing room in
that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a youth
that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased examining
that dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the moments
that during their military movement they should have at their head 3
that during their stay of four days they might have learned thought
that easier the committeemen met him at the first door and found
that either that puts the court in too bad a light replied not
that end to
that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the campaign
that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was demands
that episode so persistently and with so important an air narrated
that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy satisfied
that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of numerous
that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout cards
that evening at speranskis with only a few friends as the dine
that event acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzov of
that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain crusades
that event have been executed we forget about the others that with
that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement ourselves
that every eye she met now was immediately dropped found
that every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did felt
that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue assumption
that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was sure
that everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an deciding
that examining the relation in time of the commands to the so
that existed under the former order of things threatening to abuses
that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves all
that fear understood
that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her voronezh
that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt faces
that feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving brother
that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him whys
that first evening bolkonski spent with him having mentioned the on
that followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes speech
that for certain considerations he could not know of this implied
that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was pleasure
that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was was
that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for during
that frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him but you see i need with
that friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone isnt
that god has implanted in our souls conscience
that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and said
that grapeshot he asked denisov was
that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approached
that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the all
that had advanced beyond the village went back but as columns
that had been announced in a manifesto and about the war
that had been brought that day broadsheets
that had been chosen criticizing not the position itself position
that had been dragged out of the houses besides russian goods
that had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk thoughts
that had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the bed
that had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners note
that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay mirrors
that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in letters
that had come over her since the ball she was silent and change
that had come over them you are as like him as two peas cloud
that had formed in france unites into one group with the people
that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few story
that had no connection with what he was saying flitted thoughts
that had not been burned the kremlin which was not churches
that had not entered her mind for years thoughts of a life thoughts
that had occurred between them whatever her fathers misunderstanding
that had once been must now be different he told me once everything
that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make difficulty
that had spread by the fact that the emperors carriage had rumor
that had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized change
that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had change
that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took monstrous
that handle off as buckle did without finding some other breaks
that has been lost and the very worst dispositions and battle
that he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith implying
that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him after
that he count rostov in spite of his youth gentlemeninwaiting
that he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was deaf
that he did not wish to bind natasha and gave her perfect freedom but
that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin proved
that he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence know
that he had been like that himself but a short time before think

that very time in circumstances even more important than at
that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and at
that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders for

there and do what he was predestined to do remain
there and fire the bridge or will the french get within get
there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two went
there and there and so on and on paper all these columns march
there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless if
there are many stories of his getting to know an officer in there
there are still lights in the drawingroom she said ah
there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to though
there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile been
there at shevardino you see where the oak is but now we have was
there be a single law governing the actions of men free will if
there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding will
there been no bagration it would have been necessary to invent had
there but that no shots were being fired from the battery something
there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the entrenchments
there certainly are disgusting people thought rostov as he well
there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of diary
there dense sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish and
there do come dear countess and give me this flower as prettiest
there do you feel it i feel so strange and do you know there
there especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid happening
there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle been
there had been a remarkable crop that year had been commandeered said

there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high news
there hasnt been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
there he is do you see him ive seen him twice as i see lempereur
there he pointed to the merchants hall but our business is from
there he remained about ten minutes pierre was among those merchants
there in the presence of that helene it had all seemed clear bravo
there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his out
there is a god and future life there is truth and good and if
there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event though
there is anything come back yakov alpatych for christs if
there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four whether
there is mercy for every sin countess
there is no change i only came to have a talk about no
there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely as
there is no riding round it now i must look for the reflected
there is no step no crime or petty fraud he commits which in happen
there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears that
there is nothing but quiet and peace thank god exist
there is nothing nothing but that but even it does not sky
there is only mademoiselle bourienne society
there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen said captain
there is the future life the someone is god someone
there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous movement
there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy acting
there it is again do you hear said he pointing in the anything
there its awful two bands and three sets of singers spree
there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea and
there must be some linen left over but
there naming pierre as the man who does not give his name russians
there no victory but from all sides came the same news of was
there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds he were
there only to witness the execution with evergrowing horror brought
there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to a why
there said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek are
there seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied by the and
there she had been married during the previous winter and being also
there she paused and stood listening to the conversation conservatory
there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to the there
there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went on finding
there sufficient forage in krems is
there tea hullo
there they abused the police and bribed them made out found
there they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to were
there they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling from
there this was shown first by the fact that there were no fought
there thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached find
there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who where
there was a deafening report and all were enveloped in a trigger
there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our hut
there was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog milka a porch
there was a smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and and
there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of where
there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly because
there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded inwards
there was another more important subordination which made regiment
there was any arson which is very doubtful for no one had any if
there was between herself and her friend and how difference
there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew oh
there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and and
there was least obstruction to that action either from things which
there was no advantage in sending friants division instead though
there was no food some with more innocent games such as though
there was no holding them in till we reached the place the devils on
there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of changed
there was no one else in the room except myself so that if it voice
there was no one in the passage he went along the whole door
there was no part of the russian army that had not suffered in the up
there was no wind and the men choked in that motionless sky
there was no wind to carry away a pleasant humming and which
there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war if
there was not a trace of agitation on his face with andrew
there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and bridge
there was nothing to be surprised at another a thin little when
there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that because
there was now more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him said
there was probably an ambuscade there that
there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong and
there was something black now little lights seemed to glimmer now
there was something else important very important that i was yes
there was something not quite right about this intended marriage that
there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in anything
there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of pierre
there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but outside
there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because where
there was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the him
there were also small scratch groups of foot and horse and cavalry
there were as many advisers there as here he went on and
there were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers open
there were but a given amount of animation between them and though
there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians perished
there were four of them they rushed at me with their suddenly
there were many secondary personages accompanying the army own
there were not many of them and at last he saw how a whole back
there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts there
there were other hours he had to spend somehow and the rostovs
there were precedents there were up to that time very few but that
there were reasons she began if
there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that this
there were several french soldiers in a variety of belongings
there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon if
there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses them
there where the shouting came from a fire flared up and went over
there will be room for everybody this is a big house oh dessalles
there will hardly be an engagement today said however
there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring fortnight
there without undressing while instead of mademoiselle dozed
there womens fuss women women said alpatych puffing there
there wont be any end to it times
there would be a big battle there that
there would be great hope of saving the army to let the french
there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna father
there would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him that
there would have been so many less men in napoleons army and refused
there you see theres our center at borodino just entrenchments
there you see well
thereby to render them capable of receiving it and
therefore be readily introduced into any theory can
therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his is
therefore this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we and
therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers was
therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would and
theres a gentleman for you wonderful
theres dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and now
theres friendship for you he repeated hes joining the dear
theres law theres injustice put in the little man where
theres no one to fall in love with on campaign hes fallen as
theres not much to be amused at here said rostov and rode no
theres nothing for you to say i shall speak to him myself and
theres nothing so
theres this recruiting now
theres to be an extraordinary meeting of the nobility tomorrow
these
these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred into
these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i triviality
these are the three ways in which the historians do explain and
these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished all
these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and considered
these conversations were going on in the reception room and while
these detachments became numerous
these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisov tell
these did not meet with success either the theaters set up in troops
these documents and he wrote to the german that despite reading
these events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if all
these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish giving
these forms were lifeless but still existed there institutions
these generals seemed not to understand that this considerations
these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are like
these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history of
these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in wines
these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to reading
these letters was one from nicholas rostov to his father among
these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that who
these nations and humanity at large are tending which
these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in all
these occupations as hindrances to life and considered that all
these peasants who were evidently still amused by the seeing
these people and horses seemed driven forward by some all
these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that among
these people sans foi ni loi can give it him people who only
these questions three answers are possible to
these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people from
these russians and foreigners who propounded new and besides
these russians hang
these sayings and doings the revolution then they give a calling
these sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating out
these simple kindly people for
these simple words her look and the expression on her face and
these sounds long unheard rostovs spirits rose as at the at
these sounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he shouts
these tears that i feel to be flowing with
these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front responsibility
these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his that
these three considerations alone is based the conception of on
these two essential questions of history to
these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary by
these two round
these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some yes
these were and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that troops
these words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to at
these words are all the more remarkable because in spite of life
these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an but
these words pained her for a moment she remembered her agitation
these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a repeated
these words the mason as if tired by his long discourse after
these words to be repeated ordered
these words with vague yet joyful ideas the door opened associating
they abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy baggage army
they aimed in ordinary life often after collecting alms and which
they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs when
they all drove back from pelageya danilovnas natasha who when
they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had cousins
they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to another
they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski when
they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions petitioners
they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know standstill
they all she herself mamma and sonya should be as well that
they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk fence
they all understood that the war was not ended europe
they always seem a little ashamed 1812
they announce a victory supposing that the more people they and
they appeared ironical he said if
they appoint they appoint a decrepit blind old man positively how
they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into as
they are all suffering as i am who then is it who flashed this
they are bringing another cried one of the officers there
they are bringing her coming there they are theyll there
they are but how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden what
they are dead what shall i drive said balaga with a wink when
they are in carriages see how comfortably theyve settled so
they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease french
they are not even that they are neither fit for war nor peace but
they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative ardor
they are said the officers wont the soldiers be glad so
they are shouting again and again are all running back there
they are sixty or seventy without a gray hair or the loss of a till
they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the yes
they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand oh yes let me and
they are there you can see them there
they are while the less their direct participation in the numerous
they assure the officer on duty that they the handkerchiefs
they awaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking as
they awake he could do everything not very well but not directly
they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero a and
they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot when
they began to express their opinions of him as people always together
they blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the deed
they both felt happy we had our hands full last night that
they both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression
they both paused while the orchestra played and the man then
they bring our horses or not thought petya instinctively will
they broke off and rose as she entered cards
they broke up two squares your excellency officer
they burn the bridge or not wholl get there first will they will
they called him bonaparte now needs most deeply devised bonaparte
they called him little falcon or platosha chaffed him soldier
they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things when
they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh when
they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and face
they carried their loot with them yet to abandon what they because
they concealed from natasha natasha guessed they were talking which
they consisted of a box for cards of splendid presents
they could and continued their flight best
they could do so before
they could not cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four and
they could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might himself
they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whom
they could not understand him all these people assumed because
they could not withstand an attack knew there was only that knew
they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought if
they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army but
they did not keep to send for a friend now some expensive which
they did not show it that moscow would certainly be abandoned though
they did not stop at any one of these positions because borodino
they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him or blame
they did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater longer
they did still harder work on their own land he did not know land
they disappeared into the darkness with with their load and
they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for circle
they do it in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting why
they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still are
they dont agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered say
they dont understand our talk at all said the dancer with but
they embraced cossacks and hussars as
they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary him
they felt sure he had brought presents for them all and
they flashed with a cruel light prisoners
they formed into detachments and began firing themselves
they give immediately lose all meaning for this force is replies
they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the when
they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the when
they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they how
they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one so
they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube action
they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few when
they had emptied the samovar rostov took a pack of cards and when
they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders when
they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with when
they had kissed each other but today they felt it could meeting
they had known that you wished it the entertainment would if
they had looked it from the hill the officer had pointed out when
they had passed were stronger and that the position at positions
they had reached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of before
they had reached their destination halted piled arms and supposing
they had spent in the country years
they had started so late on the first of september the road moscow
they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and which
they had the right to fire when they liked as they approached mist
they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took but
they halted and drew in the square several french officers street
they hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give talking
they have a party arkharovs
they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them yes
they have laid in secret be turned against them let them fall plots
they have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown rise
they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of him
they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when but
they heard napoleons proclamation offering them as when
they heard the quick rustle of the countess dress she instant
they heard the sound of voices behind them beautiful
they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise instance
they keep asking me and im glad of it im happy and i love how
they kept telling us its dangerous its dangerous there
they killed the king and many other people at that time another
they knew better than i did and now you come to me how thought
they lie as white as paper clean and not as much smell peasant
they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning regiment
they locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself when
they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses atmosphere
they met she fell on his breast sobbing she could not lift her when
they might be who had crushed him whoever
they passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts as
they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few as
they played some tricks on a policeman didnt they do it when
they pleased there were very few resident landlords in the where
they prayed for the warriors she thought of her brother and when
they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have for
they put questions and gave brief replies about things anything
they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with midday
they quite understood one another as to the first part of bourienne
they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman when
they reached home and had told their mother how they had when
they reached the front several bullets sped over them and bullets
they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear the when
they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord before
they received money for it and had spent the best years of their and
they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand when
they said kutuzov was blind of one eye and
they sat a long time talking of their happiness they mustaches
they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who because
they satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in suffering
they saw rostovs rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face when
they say continued the adjutant with the same smile well
they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read powers
they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierre and
they say its burned he said its a great pity and he yes
they say pierre is quite broken by his misfortune dolokhov
they say that war has been declared replied the visitor but
they seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances as
they should abandon all established traditions and customs and that
they should do what was impossible that
they should leave her alone that
they speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand when
they spoke little even to one another and when they did it pain
they stood in my way i have an adored a priceless mother and two if
they suited the young ladies and she thanked them all for how
they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked have
they talked of peace but did not believe in its affairs
they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear do
they told us little mytishchi had been set on fire by mamonovs but
they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do that
they took his right hand placed it on something and told him to that
they understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary something
they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with but
they watched their young people executing their newly learned as
they went away each on his own account and yet it was only in burned
they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the when
they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and before
they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not so
they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to though
they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence remained
they were almost knocked over by some men who carrying stairs
they were and that if they would let him have a convoy of a where
they were as usual laughing zherkov
they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole that
they were carrying were too much for them weight
they were doing what
they were eating i think that punishment by depriving while
they were going and that much that was painful and difficult where
they were going or why if they regretted having to retreat where
they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who was as
they were hungry and very cheerful they looked at one another glowed
they were judging what with one thing and another filling in while
they were meaningless though
they were moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant aims
they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in general
they were not in the least abashed the old woman unnecessary
they were not to be seen it seemed to the count that things were off
they were out of the village they began talking again as loud when
they were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the after
they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game whether
they were pointed out please to wait ive widden quarters
they were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at dull
they were ready to drop and so said the grownup young men and till
they were silent for hours sometimes after they were sometimes
they were sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the where
they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other while
they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded while
they were throwing everything superfluous made the eyes which
they were to do next am i taken prisoner or have i taken him what
they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach where
they were to the whole rostov family their usefulness did not fact
they were under orders to advance next day zherkov
they whispered to one another casting significant looks at him that
they will be left cried
they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a accusations
they will said nesvitski no but what i should like so
they will stop it now they will be horrified at what they have now
they will swell up with russian cabbage burst with our saying
they wish so ready to be fond of him for being his anything
they wished to administer the sacrament of unction anyone
they wished to sing but because they wanted to show they were because
they woke late and were again delayed so often that they morning
they wont let us pass we are left behind and have lost chasseurs
they worked all day and didnt play remarked the tall yes
they would again fall in love with one another and that circumstances
they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairs but
theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing began
theyll make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went but
theyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident something
theyre a clean folk lads the first man went on he was but
theyre engaged that
theyre fighting heavens
theyre getting it frightfully hot flank
theyre sent out and brought back again later on it will do no if
theyre sorry for it afterwards i dont like that then
theyve made up splendid packs for me fit to cross the nesvitski
theyve not gone to bed yet what do you think mind now then
theyve sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy well
thick bones tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs crunching
thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the the
thicket the other day leaped a fearful place what a sight zavarzinsk
thief
thiers eloquently recounts he ordered his soldiers to be paid in as
thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it left
thin as a skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently as
thin hollowcheeked chekmar having got everything ready the
thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her her
thin little shoulders natashas eyes and laughter denisov sonyas
thin neck and his head that had been half shaved was again long
thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his
thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear and long
thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which his
thine almighty hand and give him victory over his enemy even as by
thing
thing
thing and not at all worse than a swallowtail or frock coat right
thing for him to do themselves turned to the right and reasonable
thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a one
thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman first
thing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say a
thing he would have to unite his fate with hers he might terrible
thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firm one
thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man said one
thing in his place thought pierre its even certain that i same
thing left to go away but where could i go one
thing over some conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish the
thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre terrible
thing that constituted the whole reward for her selfsacrifice very
thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he only
thing to do only
thing we are interested in here said the spirit of the place one
thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever one
things and one doesnt care to listen but this one talks clever
things and was busy for whole days the count and countess their
things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of these
things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclined make
things he did wrong at this period of his reign for
things he should have shown it sooner but he lets it go on for see
things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de ordinary
things in my bedroom said he to the servant who was princes
things into his mothers language prince alexander translate
things lacking coherence presented themselves one after senseless
things my
things no worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if make
things not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap take
things of which i understand nothing and the day countermarches
things packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and getting
things these arent needed said she putting aside some plates the
things to everyone and upset them lets go to the unpleasant
things to his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the all
things to such a pass that there are no carts or brought
things trying for you doesnt it prince andrew asked makes
things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of badly
things when he thought of sonya during this stay in moscow he other
things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it whether
things would have been different a fifth group sooner
think
think about it to
think aloud in her company and she had always answered him or
think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on you
think however that these condemnations have some ground i
think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the old i
think im an old man and dont understand the present state you
think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic i
think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued i
think natasha rostova you
think no one has been more courted than she she went on but i
think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but i
think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be i
think of it but i consider it my duty to let you know of it will
think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would not
think of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring then
think of the fellows audacity lying and obstinacy just
think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him to
think of us cried his wife referring to the rumors of war sake
think of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded moment
think of what is just and unjust it is understandable that a or
think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive i
think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now i
think said the prince with a smile that if you had been i
think shes asleep mamma said sonya softly i
think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is you
think so monsieur pierre he concluded you
think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and you
think so yourself and the main thing is he continued that i not
think speak weep work give vent to her anger and so on sleep
think that before discussing these questions pierre i
think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death you
think that their disagreements are the cause of this diplomatists
think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and they
think this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was i
think this would happen not
think what you are doing cried sonya i cant leave it but
thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred window
thinking about you been
thinking aloud in his wifes presence now that they had immediately
thinking especially at that moment it suffused him seized him been
thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she still
thinking of that and
thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and without
thinking without doing anything which seemed to them and
third
third a pair of womens gloves he said dear brother these the
third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying the
third and wheels began to revolve faster and faster levers and a
third class of historians the socalled historians of culture a
third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently the
third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that the
third day when something could have been done that army was the
third division and convinced himself that there really were no the
third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing the
third in the absence of opponents between two councils would a
third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his the
third of the visitors had already arrived but the rostovs who a
third order was general campan will move through the wood to the
third physical things and the fourth a combination of these now a
third their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a a
third thing what else was it you talked about and prince andrew the
third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre the
thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills marching
thirty years some thirty years ago ferapontov by alpatychs last
this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas at
this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she during
this active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen grown
this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge of
this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he and whats
this and all in a way that seemed to say we you understand
this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the take
this and guessed its reason noticed
this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas know
this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated at
this apsheron battalion marched by the redfaced miloradovich as
this aroused among the russian people but no one at the time foe
this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite can
this began pierre not sitting down but pacing the room why
this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end how
this bone a bill for thirty thousand rubles to the poor throw
this bright comet which having traveled in its orbit with at
this burden as quickly as possible on the third day after his off
this but could not go he felt uneasy and embarrassed but sat noticed
this challenge or not anatole did not release him and accept
this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroy of
this cold is tiresome they talk about medicine what is the glass
this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to hows
this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own that
this confirmed
this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most in
this couch will be my grave natasha flushed and eager that
this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev and
this crazy world in
this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he had why
this delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of of
this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living despite
this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne dessalles and during
this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on by
this dinner the count had been a member and on the committee of for
this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense from
this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows all
this enfant du don affect
this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and lad
this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and
this expression evidently pleased him he
this expression on his face pleased natasha astonishment
this expression suggested that she had resolved to significance
this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with do
this for my son and i shall always regard you as a benefactor do
this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in understand
this fundamental difference between the view held by history from
this gentlemans saber why
this good or bad pierre asked himself it is good for me bad is
this gruel isnt to your taste oh you crows youre scared so
this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his collide
this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so all
this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than during
this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not but
this he again turned round dropped his hands took the saying
this he started for the country next day obtain
this hostile and still more this disrespectful application encounter
this if you like father said the princess blushing still read
this in a moment of anger i am calm i have thought it over and said
this information when the enemy has scattered his forces in large all
this instant thought rostov fire
this is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking mind
this is a palace she said to her husband looking around why
this is absolutely true all
this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have that
this is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and when
this is gratitude this is recognition for those who have and
this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and however
this is really melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove if
this is something new ive never seen before this isnt the kosoy no
this is strange do you suppose i who could think i well
this is that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at all
this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends soldiers
this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh yes
this is very important from general dokhturov said but
this is what the emperor is thought petya no i cant so
this jesting he said stop
this last ball only the ecossaise the anglaise and the mazurka at
this last effort for all the russian troops had been broken made
this lasted only a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaming but
this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre following
this letter to the governor for princess mary she signed it wrote
this letter would be of great use to you address
this lies the purpose of the bee but the ultimate purpose of the in
this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought living
this life to love her husband her children little nicholas and in
this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could all
this little ladycountess she kept saying as she offered take
this love affair which might hinder nicholas from making a dreading
this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the song of that
this man and that man did not execute such and such maneuvers and
this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving had
this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the and
this man who is a menace to everything endure
this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet and
this man with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips also
this masha i cant reproach have not reproached and know
this messenger was michaud a frenchman who did not know event
this moment petya to whom nobody was paying any attention came at
this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so at
this morning him
this morning i turned them all out and now look its full again sit
this movement means what caused it and what force produced what
this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et all
this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in value
this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another together
this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked heard
this nicholas
this now one had to wait and endure he did not again go to knew
this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its with
this one is coming our way again he thought listening to comes
this one seems he began turning to the assistant why
this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the after
this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of in
this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the if
this peasant it was reported to him that tikhon had attached about
this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow though
this point but on each occasion had been driven back by attack
this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer after
this program or even admitting that some one general program of of
this project for it was not they who had suffered from the up
this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who for
this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at for
this question absorbed all his mental powers all else was to it
this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see in
this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer now
this ram who instead of getting into the general fold every that
this refined selection of society anna pavlovnas receptions besides
this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the in
this road your honor that way you will be killed at once a take
this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning in
this rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army confirm
this said
this said the doctor rising from his bed please go whats
this secret treasure princess mary paused uncertain containing
this seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow all
this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt to
this shrubbery was a wellknown haven of refuge for shrubbery
this side of life where everything was either emptiness and than
this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have of
this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest and
this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction comforting
this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now kamenski
this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very feared
this strikingly poetic charming girl overflowing with life for
this subject which irritated denisov now why have you kept of
this table chose and placed cards and watched those broadboned at
this terrible affair decided moscow must be abandoned the army was
this the regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged hearing
this the soldiers of denisovs squadron fed chiefly on all
this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna is
this the whole staff of the russian army was now besides
this there was something else of importance it was besides
this third party of
this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so like
this thought nicholas wheres that huntsman from he whats
this three pages were left blank in the diary and then after
this time and of no use to anyone while she felt herself so all
this time natasha sat silent glancing up at him from under all
this time they were all approaching tushins battery and a by
this to the countess if you see her give
this understood
this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree outside
this war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not of
this was an old bachelor shinshin a cousin of the countess a eyes
this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a while
this was mathematically clear as it is that if when playing kutuzov
this was necessary he did not know but he knew for certain that why
this was not and could not be done for during the whole battle but
this was not news to rostopchin he had known that moscow moscow
this was repeated by others from various sides and all became sunrise
this was speranski secretary of state reporter to the hospital
this was speranskis cold mirrorlike look which did not andrew
this was taking place in petersburg the french had already while
this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there evening
this was the fruit of anisya fedorovnas housekeeping all
this was the wife of the priest whose home it was and that she that
this was unnecessary that
this water that gorge sun
this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked turn
this way to the infantry added another with loud laughter not
this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it in
this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying and
this why
this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other fear
this woman swaying to and fro and muttering something was cap
this would not have happened he said all
this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested that
this your saber asked petya or is it yours he said is
this your saber he shouted is
thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands posen
thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had how
those above him in position and who could therefore be of use only
those advisers said he if we had listened to them all we ah
those are the french and over there pierre pointed to a ah
those around him began crossing himself with the hand observing
those behind began to halt with the same feeling with which while
those broad reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from hands
those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of only
those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of
those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any all
those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of of
those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious countess
those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed him oh
those damned germans they dont know their own country ah
those eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear words
those forces but will always be a mean what in mechanics is of
those forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless beyond
those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may the and
those german gentlemen wont win the battle tomorrow but will you
those glances expressed something more they said that she had but
those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy moment
those he dealt with having glanced at dron he at once understood of
those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need particularly
those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so visiting
those limits are very near together that the person in a bed that
those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence rakes
those moans prince andrew wanted andrew wanted to weep hearing
those moscow gossips said dolokhov and he took up the oh
those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone new judge
those of bald hills they differed from them in speech dress from
those of them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his and
those old men eh bear
those on his own side shouted angrily at his own supporter strikes
those our men there pierre inquired are
those previously incomprehensible virtues for princess another
those pure times which could never return tears of vexation that of
those ranks of infantry moved forward how
those servants said the count swaying his head oh
those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he why
those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those during
those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to together
those stockings are to be a surprise for me there
those tears were pleasant to them both but
those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the if
those voices amid the square masses of troops standing of
those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one for
those who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors and
those who had been killed and before the men had had food and replace
those who had given him food and those who had prayed before battery
those who had lately joined these according to particularly
those who have armed themselves in thy name and gird their loins of
those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains awaits
those who remained in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not by
those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed among
those who were able to get away were going of their instructions
those whom julies guests happened to choose to gossip about among
those words i said goodby to the holy folk and went hearing
those words or uttered them purposely knowing them to be spoke
those words would be sure to arouse him that
those wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commander stop
thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter thou
thou gavest to us and to our fathers and let not the scepter heritage
thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then the now

though it was the memory of a distant past then he recounted captain
though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a and
though it was unbuttoned still seemed to pinch his neck those which
though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie expression
though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of but
though not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger feeling
though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity expression

to go out with the others prepared
to go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay had
to go to the right and who to the left it is only because military is
to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess wants
to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not necessary
to grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to language
to grasp what was said he looked at the count not

to halt murmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and began

to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him seemed
to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced and
to have written to alexander my respected brother i napoleon

to hear a human voice the satisfaction of ones needs good food and
to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome horrified
to hear whether he would say anything more but kutuzov waiting

to her and to princess mary that he loved her himself
to her as an advantageous background to his elegant and presented
to her beautiful and clever they say prince is quite mad court
to her being so bright thats because shes living through importance
to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs hands

to her father clung
to her favorite hound referring
to her for a long time of the love of god of christ of the talked
to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly up
to her heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready hand
to her husband i have just been told that nothing is ready turning
to her husband who she imagined was jealous of prince andrews him
to her mind and while thinking of her nephew she thought recurred
to her mind but she remembered too how he had changed of recurred
to her mind they the french would settle in this house m vividly
to her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of a said
to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he homage
to her nephew who had entered the room attention
to her no not that i dont i cant brother
to her of his breath and the smell of him and could think only close
to her own question but no no he must yes mary he replied
to her princess mary was agitated just then because on antipathy
to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her but come
to her she pressed it hand
to her she seated herself in the drawing room to await the up
to her shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up near
to her so they gave their consent proposed
to her the best in the world so also that song at that seemed
to her the kindhearted countess was the more vexed with speaking
to her to restrain themselves for this once precious being yield
to her to think that this stern handsome man should be strange
to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and said
to her when they had any orders to give petya and natasha on turned
to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to hastened
to her witing
to her write
to hers a woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and next
to herself absence
to herself and pondered she was in a mood for brooding on listened
to herself and rushing at him embraced him pressed his head said
to herself and she moved forward without again looking round say
to herself as
to herself little andrew her eldest boy imitating his said
to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she frame
to hide his agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more tried
to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the order
to hide them and left the room quickly
to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasili suggested
to him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered talking
to him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned and spoke
to him after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing assigned
to him alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially it
to him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but this recurred
to him and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time hand
to him and borys life is only just beginning burden
to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world alien
to him and disputed with one another who should bring him nearest
to him and from that time till they came to moscow had not left beauty
to him and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became up
to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him talking
to him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the pleasure
to him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the reported
to him and took the letters turned
to him as a good match had drawn his particular attention to her her
to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an flattering
to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of up
to him balashev said that in russia the best results were listening
to him beckoned
to him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had revealed
to him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself something
to him but prince andrew replied that he would probably reconciled
to him but still he and those about him retained their old orders
to him especially the youngest the pretty one with affectionate
to him feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was talk
to him fell against the rails with a groan rostov ran up to nearest
to him for the day he had lost he was happy as a lover when the up
to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream but rostov called
to him from the time of his rescue till his illness he happened
to him happened
to him he drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg speak
to him he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly said
to him he replied i flared up and said much that was disagreeable
to him he was already enjoying that happiness when that little itself
to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house said
to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand appeared
to him in jest that if andrew got married he himself would occurred
to him in such matters to pierres timid look of inquiry hindrance
to him involuntarily came up and sat down beside him submitting
to him it
to him itself
to him listened
to him matter
to him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in open
to him of believing in the possibility of attaining unknown
to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in occurred
to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay seemed
to him pointing to the gallant apsherons remark
to him putting her arms round him and kissing him this springing
to him quite possible seemed
to him said
to him said
to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him hostile
to him straight out let people think what they will of me its speak
to him tell of the influence some of these people had on hostile
to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow seemed
to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the seemed
to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account occurred
to him that it was impossible to defend moscow and that it explained
to him that other people were all as pleased as he was seemed
to him the gloomier seemed his own appeared
to him they were russians unfamiliar
to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he was presented
to him trying not to be overheard and that all through spoke
to him we search but none are to be found the field addressed
to him whether or not they found out that their prisoners especially
to him who was appointed chief of the artillery matter
to him with curiosity listened
to him with evident pleasure listened
to him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head talking
to him words
to himself a future with sonya and that was all clear and pictured
to himself ah there will be and there are many more such said
to himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a you
to himself in another part of his mind her image rose in conviction
to himself might not be pleasant to someone else pleasant
to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs must said
to himself troublesome
to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that vasili
to hinder the robbers having lost all motive and all sense trying
to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly spoken
to his amazement had gained him the st georges cross and which
to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that resemblance
to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear therefore
to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained passage
to his daughter but natasha noticed her fathers nervousness and this
to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood answer
to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in hand
to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia them
to his estates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and away
to his face how can you judge the emperors actions what rushing
to his father with a laugh turning
to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking up
to his fatherinlaw had arranged to be free to pass himself off send
to his fathers study as the latter wished to say goodby to called
to his fathers wish to propose and postpone the wedding for conform
to his forehead by way of greeting he asked pierre whether fingers
to his gathering besides thought he all such words of come
to his greeting when the emperors health was drunk responded
to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at contrary
to his happiness he often surprised those he met by his allusions
to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itself rush
to his hobby tell me how the germans have taught you to returning
to his horses mane and pulled up beside the hussar he was almost
to his house in petersburg and now she has come here and him
to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried heavily
to his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was sinking
to his legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see something
to his lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a hand
to his lips he hastened away fingers
to his listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own seemed
to his look and went still faster along the passage reply
to his majesty lunch
to his master the count has come and denisov who had been shouted
to his memory not merely as something past but as returned
to his men go round wait for the infantry he exclaimed shouting
to his merit testimony
to his mind recurred
to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days you snuffbox
to his own feelings and those of the russian people whose expression
to his own soul vividly plainly terribly and almost as himself
to his own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i quite
to his parents debt
to his past interests and he seized on these the more unrelated
to his present state him
to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know occurred
to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate reply
to his shoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact pointing
to his sisters to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting drove
to his story attention
to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he and
to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt now
to his surprise it did not destroy the structure though it yet
to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged but
to his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took back
to his troops happening
to his two friends one of whom was a dashing hussar and the merrily
to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll contrary
to his voice which reached her from the garden suddenly listening
to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure up
to his wife and would again promise that this should really confess
to his wife relation
to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also indifferently

tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and the the
tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if the
tsar who still remained in the same attitude of indecision the
tsarevich should not be with the army do you know what he said to the

was being done was not his adjutants fault and still not what
was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him he
was being mown down by the soldiers evidently for fodder which

was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all natasha
was carried away and began to speak of these things but pierre
was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two petya
was carried through the waves of infantry and sometimes like townsman
was certainly goodlooking and sensible no one up to now had she
was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive life
was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and kutuzov
was chief
was clear and frosty above the dirty illlit streets above the it
was clearly impossible but a freak of fate made the which
was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly officer
was coming and turning to her mother what
was coming to take her turn at watching let us go princesses
was coming to tell you so i
was committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself it
was commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for labor
was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent from valuev
was connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm alexeevich
was connected with the great event foretold in the apocalypse he he
was conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great napoleon
was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two later
was considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure nicholas
was correct alpatych was not at home he had gone to the statement
was correct others that it was not and explained the false wounded
was count bezukhov name
was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously knot
was crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know else
was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet and earth
was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i one
was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up he was sitting he
was decided to move to tarutino only when the army had got it
was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at i
was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat auersperg
was definite who was lieutenant who captain who was a everything
was delighted that pierre whom he did not much care for had too
was delighted with denisovs skill he was asked again and everyone
was demanded of him but still that happy result always what
was descending from above near by the campfires were moisture
was destroying itself at such a rate that though its interference
was did not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has once
was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpatych and again dron
was displeased to see that the company consisted almost rostov
was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written emperor
was diverted by the everincreasing crowds moving toward the attention
was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the he
was doing he
was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there it
was done by the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in this
was drawing near him
was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this who
was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the him
was driving kutuzov looked at them searchingly stopped his he
was driving past yusupovs house just now said berg with a i
was due to the bad state of their affairs sonya was nearly out
was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of contrary
was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her evidently
was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of it
was empty that everyone had left it the faces of those who moscow
was engrossed by watching the family circle separated attention
was equally bad as long as they remained with their own pursuers
was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with ball
was even then understood russian authors are still fonder of campaign
was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish it
was eventempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this she
was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he it
was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his it
was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such it
was evident that prince andrews ironical tone toward the it
was evident that this strange strong man was under the it
was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think natasha
was evidently forced not only the guests but even the animation
was evidently of that sort he had a science the theory of pfuel
was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and newcomer
was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank he who
was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings now
was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the he
was evidently suffering both physically and mentally there was he
was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands she
was evidently wiser than his general goes up to auersperg and who
was excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet everything
was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher boris
was expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski was spending andrew
was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an napoleon
was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering she
was far from being the same words or the same order that it
was fast asleep with his head on his arm he
was feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and simple she
was filled with their groans which seemed to melt into one army
was filling her soul there could be rich people and poor sorrow
was finishing with these words affronted
was flattering quite simply and naturally what
was flung out violently head
was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not he
was flying toward him with a terrific whizz and then he ball
was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the zherkov
was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing natasha
was fought austerlitz
was fought battle
was fought on the twentyfifth not a shot was fired by either redoubt
was found under the old merchants pillow he was tried knife
was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it speech
was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brickred it
was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was who
was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to natasha
was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other she
was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine she
was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the close
was genuine in egypt where forty centuries looked down upon genius
was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the it
was glad to hear this his mind was occupied by the interests andrew
was going home to voronezh and rostov persuaded him to denisov
was going on around him or not one thing was certain that he what
was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means what
was going on before him so the way in which these people what
was going on in front of him at the battery he now saw what
was going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we what
was going on she called sonya to her and instead of reproaching that
was going on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea looting
was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i i
was going to her first grand ball she had got up at eight natasha
was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together willarski
was good indeed excellent moreover the rostovs affairs were it
was gradually led on to do so captivity
was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and he
was growing cold on the bare floor quilt
was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many it
was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud it
was hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if superfluous
was happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face what
was hated by the commune must be hesitating between the two and
was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel when
was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking what
was heard and then another at first irregularly at varying shot
was heard on all sides hurrah
was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and command
was heard to say his voice was calm and deliberate moscow silent
was hearing though with no intention of contradicting it since he
was heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather everybody
was helenes mother princess kuragina she was continually marriage
was her brother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her how
was her wonder at the shortsightedness of men who seek greater
was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone he
was herself horrified at what she had said and
was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended he
was his feet bear
was his first thought and i did not know this suffering today
was his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of as
was holding the englishmans hand and clearly and dolokhov
was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure morel the pierre
was i
was ill and her engagement broken off and that he would do natasha
was impossible first because as experience shows that a it
was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken it
was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at it
was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of it
was impossible to give battle before information had been it
was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year it
was in a bad temper because prince vasili was coming or whether he
was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely pierre
was in a state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill house
was in an agreeable afterdinner mood he looked straight pierre
was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the he
was in danger they could not think of anything but how to feel
was in effect already abandoned the other generals however moscow
was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that it
was in france a man of genius napoleon he conquered there
was in french it
was in gorki near the center of the russian position the kutuzov
was in her sisterinlaws room prince andrew in a traveling princess
was in his place waiting everyone
was in july 1805 and the speaker was the wellknown anna it
was in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future with there
was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing pierre
was in that wellknown afterdinner mood which more than napoleon
was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons to the petya
was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut andrew
was increased by the fact that the russian commanders not position
was inevitable it
was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could this
was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered murat
was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his mouth
was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not how
was it about asked nicholas what
was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she how
was it noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of neither
was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading concern
was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than how
was it what
was its no use your going to the commander in chief clavichord
was ivanushka with you and
was jealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty she
was just and that really no answer could be made to it but remark
was just back from turkey where the war had terminated so andrew
was just coming into fashion were danced iogel had taken a which
was just dawning on approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed morning
was just entering the newcomer wore a blue swallowtail coat with who
was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he pierre
was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled it
was just then that he received a letter from his wife who it
was just this peculiarity of speranskis mind that particularly it
was just what he used to be as before he was absentminded and he
was just when the counts affairs had become so involved that it
was known and shown in every detail on the maps and locality
was known drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor brotherhood
was kuragin whom she could not help watching as they were this
was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his it
was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz it
was laughing in advance at what magnitski was going to speranski
was leading him forward and experienced great happiness power
was led by the groom in attendance on him while the viflyanka
was left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the he
was left in the rear guard ill with fever he went to smolensk general
was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large followed
was listening and considering natasha
was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence his
was living with his mother who if she saw him dying would not he
was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he it
was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas not till it
was looking at her with enraptured eyes denisov
was looking into princess marys eyes pierre
was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy he
was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure who
was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript army
was lost no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the battle
was lost understood all the difficulties of the russian campaign
was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand pierre
was lying body
was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress and
was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons timokhin
was lying in a squirrelfur dressing gown on a divan he
was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the natasha
was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other which
was made for him was approaching the icon way
was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and visitors
was making for troitsa which
was mentioned he had said absentmindedly yes shes good beauty
was met by gabriel marya dmitrievnas gigantic footman he
was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his kutuzov
was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she sonya
was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down table
was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her she
was much offended and the young ladies summer dresses could schoss
was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting there
was music and suddenly i felt so depressed there
was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with it
was my lover she said in french with her coarse plainness dolokhov
was napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp bonaparte riding it
was natasha with her surprise her delight her shyness and such
was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding mitya
was naughty mitya
was nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when the it
was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the it
was necessary his income would be reduced by three fourths but he it
was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save it
was needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the head what
was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with what
was needed which he did not possess jurisprudence
was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i declared
was never pleased at bolkonskis engagement to natasha said the i
was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse fourth
was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a it
was no answer to any of these questions except one and there
was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servants there
was no less astounding than it was in egypt in italy in time
was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his pierre
was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through it
was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the she
was no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the there
was no need to say more julies face shone with triumph and there
was no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from there
was no wind as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the there
was nobody else in the room addressed pierre there
was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew it
was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he
was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head and his whole there
was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied there
was not always old but this is what ill do natasha ill have he
was not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said bolkonski
was not at all surprised at this question he understood pierre
was not available besides as a result of the frequent scouting
was not blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than path
was not disfigured by the approach of death it was the expression
was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village and
was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight rostov
was not in a normal state in that respect all the powers of mind
was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry heart
was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and sonya
was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the zoology
was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer wintzingerode
was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now fellow
was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling it
was not offensive to his master nicholas knew that this daniel scorn
was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they he
was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little that
was not pushing him at all who
was not satisfied with her own words she felt that they did natasha
was not satisfied with this reply alpatych
was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary it
was not then so definitely settled as it is now my father then matter
was not thinking about her but only picturing her to himself he
was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the it
was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the princess
was not upset or pained by what she had said anatole
was not vain he did not mind what people thought of him still he
was not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life it
was not with them the count decided to stay with marya countess
was not yet ready but pierre learned that it was being balloon
was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness there
was nothing he could teach them all the powers of his soul there
was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled there
was nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i there
was nothing terrible in the one small distant fire in the there
was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow there
was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was there
was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips petya
was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment there
was now an expression of quiet solemnity there
was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and bilibin
was now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now he
was now his only hope karay with all the strength age had left who
was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already it
was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible improbable
was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili there
was now replaced by another especially since he had battlefield
was now taking place that
was now with the inhabitants of moscow it was long since people it
was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was the ermolov
was nursing her boy when the sound of pierres sleigh was she
was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions kutuzov
was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her alone
was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue dolokhov
was of this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and dron
was of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with moment
was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs julie
was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its schoss
was often on dolokhovs face when looking at him yes expression
was often to be found ermolov
was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for it
was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other town
was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one there
was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the there
was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a natasha
was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume it
was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of pierre
was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants dron
was one of those retired gentlemeninwaiting of whom there pierre
was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty there
was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness it
was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to it
was only because they had to leave billets they had grown it
was only busy causing him annoyance pierre
was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given it
was only for buying too many and too expensive things to her other it
was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost it
was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or it
was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into there
was only one hut available for the regimental commander there
was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything there
was only pretending not to notice him and that his whole bogdanich
was only two horses length from the equestrian with the balashev
was our militia of any use to the empia not at all it only and
was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from denisov
was out of the question for her to refuse him and therefore it
was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about his supper
was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in she
was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the screams major
was pallid and quivered face
was papa which natasha and which petya everyone shouted which
was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a himself
was particularly discontented and out of temper whether bolkonski
was particularly noticeable on nesvitskis usually laughing this
was particularly pleasant at that moment they had recollection
was particularly struck by the beauty of a small rostov
was passing but before he had finished his greeting there was a who
was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly what
was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a it
was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which box
was petya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natasha and a girl
was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the better
was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the himself
was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and which
was placarded everywhere following
was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at it
was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was not it
was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but it
was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift it
was plain that this well referred to much that they both it
was pleasant after his reception by the austrians to speak if not it
was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love it
was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at he
was pointing out to the countess the most important peronskaya
was possible his conversation was always sprinkled with that
was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperors the olmutz
was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a julie
was present was held in the cathedral for the russian nicholas
was pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had crowd
was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the it
was probably there too ermolov
was proceeding as usual denisov who had been losing at squadron
was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and samovar
was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own he
was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor he
was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if ruler
was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair the plait
was punished by an order to burn down his houses rostopchin
was quite correct on the twentyfourth of july but on the this
was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor it
was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he it
was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she peronskaya
was quite round his back chest shoulders and even his arms head
was quite true but the count the countess and natasha looked this
was raevski who had spent the whole day at the most this
was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark and
was really of small importance in view of such events as the krems
was received at the emperors quarters that very day of a fresh news
was reduced to thirtysix thousand though not more than five pillage
was released the clock began to whirr and the chimes to spring
was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp a sventsyani
was removed and the water could flow to waste pierre felt channel
was repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and physician
was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before and
was resting on his hand raevski twitching forward the black eyes
was returning to bilibins house thinking out a letter to his he
was ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired he
was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came he
was right or wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes undertaken
was rostovs face troubled
was rubbing him down another valet with his finger over the valet
was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand a short man was face
was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the which
was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a it
was running through the marsh the french were evidently firing red
was running to and fro and whispering another troyka there
was sad and irritable all that time especially when her natasha
was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into this
was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his berg
was satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple she
was saying he regarded from her standpoint he
was saying petya
was seen smile
was serious as always only his eyes were brighter than mustache
was serving as a private but the command of the extreme left dolokhov
was shaking him groom
was shaped by the will of one man peter the great and that russia
was sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began air
was short and very thin but broadboned of coarse robust pfuel
was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few pierre
was shown to the room prepared for him and the rostovs denisov
was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large birds
was silent and agreed with her nicholas
was silent awhile he
was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to pierre
was silent he
was silent it occurred to none of them that it was three oclock mary
was silent pierre
was silent throughout the drive to pierres inquiries willarski
was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle it
was sincerely fond of dolokhov for his cleverness and anatole
was singing in passionate tones gazing with gazing with his he
was sitting at a small table chattering with masha her princess
was sitting at a window in the first room with a french chernyshev
was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to sonya
was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the berg
was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses sonya
was sitting in the drawingroom where shinshin had engaged pierre
was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostov had telyanin
was sitting noisily backward and forward made efforts to control he
was sitting on a trunk and having undone her palecolored maid
was sitting sobbing in the corridor marya dmitrievna for sonya
was sixteen and it was the year 1809 the very year to which natasha
was slipping away from him world
was smashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to glass
was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horses someone
was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question pierre
was so disconcerted by this longforeseen inquiry that without count
was so far away that as appeared later he could not know napoleon
was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of i
was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the it
was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of there
was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that roads
was so strange that one could not take it in but then the said
was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room she
was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be activity
was so well established that no one took his freaks petersburg
was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred sonya
was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather there
was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes were he
was sonya with burntcork mustache and eyebrows circassian
was speaking as usual in french and as if after long she
was speaking to everyone conjecturing where they were now officer
was spending the last of his leave at home a fourth letter nicholas
was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk kozlovski
was st natalias day and the name day of two of the rostovs the it
was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at napoleon
was standing at the door when denisov said this he slipped in petya
was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated natasha
was standing over the others his face with its fine straight coat
was staying at prince vasili kuragins and sharing the pierre
was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say pierre
was still fresh in him which
was still insisting that the french had retreated and had dolgorukov
was still living in pierres house the two younger ones had waist
was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful mary
was still no improvement in the countess health but it was there
was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were it
was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch karataev
was still stranger though of this prince andrew said nothing what
was still warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a air
was stonestill like the moon and its light and the everything
was stranger
was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house pierre
was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a metallic
was such peace all around such blessedness that one dont want there
was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at drums
was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and really
was suffering physically he the commander in chief a serene he
was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the this
was swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but he that
was taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those he
was taken today but he knows nothing im keeping him with me he
was taking place in the covered trap several times rostov what
was talking about the army and about the enemy who was everyone
was talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or shinshin
was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre wife
was talking to anatole about paris it was not calculation that she
was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the face
was telling him pierre
was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which he
was terribly close to him she already had power over him and she
was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into bagration
was that asked boris who
was that done which settled the matter and who was to blame when
was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full it
was that he had greatly improved during these last five previously
was that he slept very little and instead of sleeping in his him
was that he was indifferent because something else explanation
was that the military governor himself was being asked at who
was the affair of the sovereign but as far as she personally was that
was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft the two borzois him
was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found he
was the case at thermopylae so why should he have made such a told
was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sons midwinter
was the counts favorite dance which he had danced in his this
was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the it
was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the it
was the dissemination of ideas the printing press could have aim
was the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank this
was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december 1820 natasha it
was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his it
was the final proof that events had matured the tightly coiled out
was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all pavlovnas
was the first to catch his eye he sent him hope
was the first to meet her as the countess room could only nicholas
was the french army his opponent who threw away the rapier fencing
was the good of bringing him tikhon interrupted hastily what
was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general said and
was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied this
was the longdrawn shouts of thousands of voices his horse and enemy
was the more readily your object might be attained he said steward
was the officer your honor stained it answered the it
was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now that
was the only person really attached to him said
was the packing of the carpets the count had valuable authority
was the representative and in helenes salon which pavlovna
was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood why
was the safest and though he would have been glad to be of officers
was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his he
was the same furniture the same walls sounds and smell and there
was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the it
was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass pierre
was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment vodka

was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line everyone
was wearing a blue swallowtail coat shoes and stockings and he
was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot work
was what had happened to him two days before princess marys that
was what the face of each soldier and each officer enjoyable
was why anna pavlovna disapproved which
was with everyone in the regiment and how satisfied his father was he
was with the russian army in paris when the news of his nicholas
was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid he
was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and he
was wounded who

was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of wife
was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult something
was your sons turn to be conscripted but no fear you it
wascal said denisov the
washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch in she
washing and dressing prince andrew came into the diplomats after

we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that only
we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the if
we all have to die but
we are all going to s now
we are all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot think
we are at home on thursdays today is thursday so please mothers
we are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for petya
we are going replied nicholas reluctantly for today as yes
we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of endeavors
we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that while
we are nice to know and then the emperor he began but loved
we are prepared to respect and honor you but all the generation
we are really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive where
we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before there
we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of yes
we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle so
we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals then
we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of the impurity
we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to if
we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred once
we can attain our three chief aims 1 selfknowledge for man that
we can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of all
we can now turn our thoughts to the second bonaparte but vanquished
we cannot accurately estimate his genius in austria or frenchmen
we cannot understand one another and he remained unnecessary
we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of war
we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything if
we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a when
we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in which
we dont love people so much for the good they have done us as says
we dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions point
we dont take it tomowwow hell snatch it fwom under our if
we ever have thought could
we find a general law of necessity to which he like philosophic
we find that a command can never be the cause of the event events
we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with ones
we fought before he said not letting the french pass as if
we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon him
we get to vienna ill get rid of it there but in these if
we had no idea never guessed at all there
we have a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round last
we have altered much very much since then said prince yes
we have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently where
we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas if
we have been summoned here not to discuss whether its best that
we have brought away the icons and my dowry bed all the what
we have each of us two pistols but whats this he prepared
we have grain belonging to my brother she said but
we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than retreat
we have once seen through illusion
we have still six hundred quarters left he inquired them
we have three cold dishes then asked the cook shall
we have time to change clothes shall
we hope to define the unknown can
we in moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored spoken
we killed a score or so of moreorderers but we did no harm know
we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself is yes
we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above the when
we know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne now
we live thank heaven without offense among these folk too here
we live we shall see replied bilibin his face again if
we may allot petersburg life and especially the life of its life
we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who love the that
we may consider we always regard it as the result partly individual
we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and plain
we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there whatever
we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the if
we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good time now shall
we men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see are
we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is china
we must act pierre raised his notebook and began to read but
we must give him an answer but
we must go go go tomorrow
we must have another entree ah goodness gracious he forgetting
we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond inevitability
we must love and we must believe that we live not only today on live
we my dear boy its terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack and
we never hear a word but dolokhov is mentioned they swear by him it
we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is increased
we not bagration have
we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him as
we now send for berg asked boris he would drink shouldnt
we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can if
we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his while
we only dreamed it or were told about him if
we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that continued
we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a place
we really lost master are
we really quite lost your excellency he asked again are
we receive a letter from him however god grant that time
we retreat after the battle but send a courier to petersburg short
we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the yes
we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive freedom
we see only our weakness and his greatness understanding
we shall be late said princess helene turning her papa
we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not historians
we shall have to deal with kutuzov said napoleon we tomorrow
we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and action
we shall receive news i have a favorable presentiment birthday
we shall see entrenchments
we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the ally
we should ask the emperor most respectfully ask his continued
we should attack their line of communication he began french
we sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into as
we speak of the migration of the peoples and the whether
we the commanders far from having to urge the men on or that
we think we thoroughly understand those
we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as says
we to continue firing he asked are
we to do with this man he added addressing himself to pierre as are
we to find suvorovs now je vous demande un peu4 said he are
we tried to unite them with the evident intention of giving campaign
we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest if
we watch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity when
we were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit time
we were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all ah
we were rejoicing at his happiness and such a lofty angelic soul when
we were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better woman
we were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the hussar the hussar and
we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of cause
we werent told anything there were some twenty of us lying fever
weak and alone with no ground to stand on ridiculous
weak and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was was
weak and the right flank too extended he went on thats flank
weak figure number two he squeaked fire medvedev his
weak old courtier and by russians as something indefinite dissolute
weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did having
weakness the one to which he had confessed when admitted greatest
wealth is in napoleons hands the russian army only incalculable
wealth or rank secondly prince andrew was no longer as young birth

were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule the steps
were deserted the air was full of smoke and the smell of lanes
were detached from real affairs and did not link up with consultations

were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away they
were doing something near the pit with pale faces and frenchmen

with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of doctor
with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes galloped up to denisov lad
with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous replied
with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes dolokhov
with a colonel of forty to whom denisov had introduced terms
with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room and
with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to go him

with a melancholy smile as it is not convenient in the alpatych
with a merry sparkle in his eyes denisov

with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been and
with a particularly dignified and sad deference this shade of behaved

with her table
with her when anna pavlovna called him away on the conversation
with her when were married la petite est gentille along
with her without once mentioning prince andrew i couldnt begin hour
with him about everything if he replied and argued it was agreed
with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and conversation
with him and also that at the emperors headquarters dissatisfied

with him it means that that is the right thing to do if alliance
with him less than ever by the emperors orders bagration agreed
with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and happiness
with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked pleased
with his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration together
with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for up
with his breast toward the swords meaning them to pierce forward

with his daughters unreasonable character up
with his door open giving orders that every messenger should be slept
with his face still more flushed commanded the men more officer
with his fathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and bore
with his feet turned under him its the very devil what dolokhov

with his head in his hands his face expressed suffering he before
with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose him
with his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold one

with lanterns were bustling about in the porch the immense servants
with large and small bells their runners squeaking and sleighs
with laughing eyes these germans are firstrate fools dont seconds
with life offered him such consolation of disillusionment
with life or because of those memories of a childhood that could part
with little noise within two steps of prince andrew and dropped

with these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable armed
with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man fedorovna
with thirty thousand men it is not difficult to capture fortresses
with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison
with this mental change he has grown physically much together
with this mist and over the whole expanse and through that mingled
with this order for there were two hundred and thirty complying
with those about him began he alone said that the battle disagreement
with those dreadful wicked temptations was a torment overflowing
with those gifted with an ardent imagination though he had case
with three hundred serfs but one of these estates had estate
with thy neighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that happiness
with time it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under but
with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle stirrup

with wellprovisioned sutlers and austrian jews offering all swarmed
with what object and so on been
with what pierre was saying but could not the latter sympathize
with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer smile
with which he had come that in spite of all his intentions
with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with efforts
with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded severity
with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of gaiety

within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various correct
within him against the someone to whom what was happening might up
within him as happens at critical moments of life whether it throb
within him his soul was occupied with something important and deep
within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled found
within its shores and seemed to have become calm but the subsided
within me and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all is
within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the are
within the houses was still asleep natasha experienced a everybody
within the limits of virtue our order should provide means passions

without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat denisov
without answering or looking at his host sorted his alpatych

wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the the
wood it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was the
wood it was plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the
wood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done the
wood the old counts horse a sorrel gelding called otradnoe
wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth the
wooden beetles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul with
wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone stillunplastered
word attack is always on your tongue but you dont see that we the
word he uttered and would afterwards with dessalles or by single
word in the officers voice in the expression of his face and in the
word just one for gods sake cried anatole one
word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as the
word of command the
word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can a
word or look of his never taking their blissfully movement
word that filled his soul with joy and
word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i a
worded the day before namely that the commander in chief clearly
words
words
words
words
words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not dunyashas
words and sentiments of various generals and not the beautiful
words and so it was those
words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in those
words and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door pierres
words apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible his
words chance and genius become superfluous the
words chance and genius do not denote any really existing the
words gallop off to korchevo and carry out instructions the
words i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i napoleons
words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to bennigsens
words of abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other then
words of prayer and the sobbing of the counts old valet heard
words of rostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to the
words of the statutes and these remained in his mind last
words that a true freemason should be a zealous worker benefactors
words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any those
words that it is a law other
words to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a into
words to her only in her imagination natasha this time gave same
words to officers he had known in the turkish war friendly
words were hardly understood by the troops no one could kutuzovs
words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which her
wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas denisov
wore a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a he
wore it in all his wars she still did not take out grandfather
work
work as soon as possible some
work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or to
work nearer to her her
work of men men are his tools she looked a little above the
work on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the the
work on which he is engaged even with the air he breathes or the
work once more to
work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all my
work too at first her intervention in the business of packing to
worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church servants
working his way with his elbows but the woman just in resolutely
working the screws himself and
workmen and the peasants caught the commissaries who industrious
workmen came out the smith wrenching himself free from the tavern the
workshops so the first task pierre had to face was one for and
world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic
world but we are a different matter without knowing why or the
world but what am i to do if i love her he thought and he the
world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough the
world his father and mother were much the same only a little home
world i have not lived till now at last i live but i cant live the
world is not right the
world is well known where the time between the action and external
world of strenuous and free activity quite opposed to the spiritual a
worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with all
worn face alpatych told how he had been sent there and how pale
worn heavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her and
worried her she got up and walking on tiptoe with crossness
worried him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he that
worse everything became especially his own affairs the the
worse than others no
worse than this one not
worse today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone was
worst morals a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest very
worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a was
worst of all i am growing old thats the thing there wont and
worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his the
worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have the
worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am be
worth tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in it
worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his a
worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she considered
wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove it
wostov how are you how are you he called out still in ah
would adhere there and it really did cross
would all have to go begging the count was so weak and they
would ally himself with russia unless he were mad swede
would ask mercy but im being courtmartialed for bwinging i
would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything and that
would be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to really
would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature it
would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his remark
would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to stupid
would be at his youthfulness and yet in the arrangement of everyone
would be better to put a in bs place and b in ds or on the it
would be decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not fate
would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has it
would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case it
would be fine gentlemen that
would be friends and how happy they would be on natashas husbands
would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems it
would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon it
would be if things were different it
would be made free and so simple that there would be no everything
would be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and there
would be nothing or mere content without form unlimited
would be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets division
would be regarded by the secular authorities matter
would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he attack
would be taken immediately to free his serfs and that till then steps
would be the best way that
would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of it
would become differences
would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other she
would content himself with that hint kutuzov
would cure her and that it was all nonsense and it was medicine
would do the honors of bogucharovo for him i should be bourienne
would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at views
would fall upon his doting old head planning beforehand what he it
would feel his absence very acutely she attributed immense she
would follow him battalion
would gather there for a day or two the rest of the year visitors
would get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no them
would go to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own affair
would go to the three hills others whispered that augustin clergy
would go with you but on my honor im up to here and he pointed i
would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he what
would have a dispute but long afterwards pierre to his wife
would have aroused although he was in retirement and had now no men
would have been amazed at it at any other time uncle himself else
would have been clear and complete one might believe or reply
would have been different if your serene highness had not things
would have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently it
would have been handsome had it not been for his thin nose
would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i it
would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i they
would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field he
would have been senseless first because napoleons it
would have been the capital of the world and the french the paris
would have considered rather bad form but who was liked acquaintances
would have done she felt bound to say and do she went into they
would have embraced her but blushing she stepped aside he
would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres natasha

wringing her hands out
